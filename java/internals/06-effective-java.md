## Chapter 2: Creating and Destroying Objects

---

### Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

**The Problem:** The usual way to expose object creation (public constructors) is inflexible, offers no control over how instances are created, and leads to awkward APIs when multiple constructors with similar parameters are needed.

**The Rule:** Consider static factory methods as the main or additional way to obtain instances. They give names, control over instantiation, and flexibility in return types.

Static factory methods offer several advantages. They have descriptive names (e.g. `BigInteger.probablePrime` instead of `BigInteger(int, int, Random)`) that make intent clearer. They can return the same object on repeated calls, which supports caching, singletons, and instance control. They can return subtypes of their declared return type, which allows compact APIs (e.g. `Collections` exposing many implementations via interfaces without public implementation classes). The returned type can vary by input or by release (e.g. `EnumSet` choosing `RegularEnumSet` or `JumboEnumSet`). They also support service-provider frameworks such as JDBC, where the service access API is a static factory. Downsides: classes without public or protected constructors can't be subclassed, and static factories can be harder to discover than constructors; using consistent naming conventions (`from`, `of`, `valueOf`, `getInstance`, `create`, `newInstance`, `getType`, `newType`, `type`) helps with discoverability.

**Code Example:**
```java
public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b) {
    return b ? Boolean.TRUE : Boolean.FALSE;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Static factory methods have names, which improves readability
- They allow returning cached/preconstructed instances and instance control (singletons, etc.)
- They can return subtypes, enabling interface-based APIs
- Use common naming conventions for better discoverability
- Classes that rely only on static factories cannot be subclassed

---

### Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters

**The Problem:** Telescoping constructors do not scale with many optional parameters and are hard to read and maintain, while the JavaBeans pattern splits construction across multiple calls and makes objects mutable and inconsistent during construction.

**The Rule:** When a class has many optional parameters (four or more), use the Builder pattern so objects are constructed in one step with clear, fluent client code.

Telescoping constructors force many positional arguments and are error-prone (swapped arguments can compile). JavaBeans allow inconsistent state, require mutability, and complicate thread safety. The Builder pattern combines a constructor or static factory for required parameters with setter-like methods for optional parameters, then calls `build()` to create an immutable instance. It is readable, supports optional parameters, and permits validation in the builder and `build()` method. The builder can be reused with different configurations, supports multiple varargs parameters, and works well with class hierarchies via parallel abstract/concrete builder types. Trade-offs: extra builder creation cost and more boilerplate, so it's best when there are enough parameters (around four or more).

**Code Example:**
```java
NutritionFacts cocaCola = new NutritionFacts.Builder(240, 8)
    .calories(100).sodium(35).carbohydrate(27).build();
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use builders for classes with many optional parameters (around four or more)
- Prefer builders over telescoping constructors for readability and safety
- Prefer builders over JavaBeans when you need immutability and consistency
- Builders work well with class hierarchies (abstract builders, covariant return types)

---

### Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type

**The Problem:** Ensuring a class has at most one instance is common, but ad hoc singleton designs are fragile under serialization and reflection.

**The Rule:** Make the singleton explicit via a public `static final` field or a static factory, or, preferably, use a single-element enum to guarantee single instantiation, including with serialization and reflection.

Two classic approaches: (1) public `static final` field, and (2) static factory returning the singleton. Both require a private constructor to prevent additional instances. For serializable singletons, add a `readResolve` that returns the singleton instance to prevent deserialization from creating extra copies. The enum approach is preferred: it is concise, inherently serializable, and robust against reflection and deserialization. Enum singletons cannot extend another class (only implement interfaces).

**Code Example:**
```java
public enum Elvis {
    INSTANCE;
    public void leaveTheBuilding() { ... }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use a single-element enum as the preferred way to implement a singleton
- For serializable singletons, provide `readResolve`
- Enum singletons cannot extend another class

---

### Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor

**The Problem:** Utility classes (static methods/fields only) should not be instantiated, but the compiler adds a default public constructor if none is declared.

**The Rule:** Add a private constructor that throws if invoked so the class cannot be instantiated or subclassed.

**Code Example:**
```java
public class UtilityClass {
    private UtilityClass() {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use a private constructor to prevent instantiation
- Throwing `AssertionError` in that constructor is a useful safeguard
- This pattern also blocks subclassing

---

### Item 5: Prefer dependency injection to hardwiring resources

**The Problem:** Classes that depend on resources (e.g. dictionaries) often hardwire them as static fields or singletons, which is inflexible and hard to test.

**The Rule:** Pass required resources (or factories for them) into the constructor instead of hardwiring; this improves flexibility, reusability, and testability.

Hardwiring assumes a single resource and blocks multiple or test-specific implementations. Passing resources into constructors (or static factories/builders) enables different configurations without changing the class. Use `Supplier<T>` or similar for resource factories when lazy creation is needed. Dependency injection frameworks like Dagger, Guice, and Spring can manage wiring in large projects.

**Code Example:**
```java
public class SpellChecker {
    private final Lexicon dictionary;

    public SpellChecker(Lexicon dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = Objects.requireNonNull(dictionary);
    }
    public boolean isValid(String word) { ... }
    public List<String> suggestions(String typo) { ... }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Inject dependencies via constructors (or static factories/builders)
- Avoid static utility classes and singletons for resource-dependent behavior
- Use `Supplier<T>` for resource factories when appropriate
- DI improves flexibility and testability

---

### Item 6: Avoid creating unnecessary objects

**The Problem:** Creating functionally equivalent objects repeatedly is wasteful in time and memory, especially when objects are immutable and can be reused.

**The Rule:** Reuse objects instead of creating new ones when they are functionally equivalent. Use static factories over constructors, cache heavy objects like `Pattern`, and prefer primitives to boxed primitives to avoid accidental autoboxing.

**Code Example:**
```java
public class RomanNumerals {
    private static final Pattern ROMAN = Pattern.compile(
        "^(?=.)M*(C[MD]|D?C{0,3})(X[CL]|L?X{0,3})(I[XV]|V?I{0,3})$");

    static boolean isRomanNumeral(String s) {
        return ROMAN.matcher(s).matches();
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Reuse immutable objects instead of creating new ones
- Prefer static factory methods when they reuse instances
- Cache expensive objects like compiled `Pattern`s
- Prefer primitives to boxed primitives to avoid autoboxing
- Do not use object pooling for lightweight objects

---

### Item 7: Eliminate obsolete object references

**The Problem:** In garbage-collected languages, references that are no longer used can still be retained by data structures, causing memory leaks and performance problems.

**The Rule:** When a class manages its own memory (e.g. stacks, caches), null out references once they are no longer needed; otherwise the garbage collector cannot reclaim the referred objects.

**Code Example:**
```java
public Object pop() {
    if (size == 0)
        throw new EmptyStackException();
    Object result = elements[--size];
    elements[size] = null;  // Eliminate obsolete reference
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Null out references when they become obsolete if the class manages its own memory
- Common leak sources: stacks, caches, listeners/callbacks
- Use `WeakHashMap` for caches driven by key lifetime; use eviction for others
- Null only when necessary; prefer scoping to remove references

---

### Item 8: Avoid finalizers and cleaners

**The Problem:** Finalizers and cleaners are unpredictable in when (or whether) they run, hurt performance, and are not a reliable way to reclaim resources.

**The Rule:** Do not use finalizers or cleaners for resource management. Use `try-with-resources` with `AutoCloseable`. Reserve finalizers/cleaners only for safety nets or reclaiming noncritical native peers.

Finalizers are deprecated in Java 9; cleaners are the replacement but still unreliable. There is no guarantee they run promptly or at all. They delay reclamation, can block on a low-priority finalizer thread, and have substantial overhead (e.g. ~50x slower). Uncaught exceptions in finalizers are ignored. Finalizers expose classes to finalizer attacks.

**Code Example:**
```java
public class Room implements AutoCloseable {
    private static final Cleaner cleaner = Cleaner.create();

    private static class State implements Runnable {
        int numJunkPiles;
        State(int numJunkPiles) { this.numJunkPiles = numJunkPiles; }
        @Override public void run() {
            System.out.println("Cleaning room");
            numJunkPiles = 0;
        }
    }

    private final State state;
    private final Cleaner.Cleanable cleanable;

    public Room(int numJunkPiles) {
        state = new State(numJunkPiles);
        cleanable = cleaner.register(this, state);
    }

    @Override public void close() { cleanable.clean(); }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Avoid finalizers and cleaners for resource management
- Use `AutoCloseable` and `try-with-resources` instead
- Use cleaners only as safety nets or for native peer cleanup
- State objects used by cleaners must not reference the enclosing object

---

### Item 9: Prefer try-with-resources to try-finally

**The Problem:** Closing resources manually with `try-finally` is verbose, easy to get wrong, and can hide the primary exception when both try and finally throw.

**The Rule:** Use `try-with-resources` for any resource that must be closed; it guarantees closing and suppresses secondary exceptions while preserving the primary one.

**Code Example:**
```java
static void copy(String src, String dst) throws IOException {
    try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(src);
         OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(dst)) {
        byte[] buf = new byte[BUFFER_SIZE];
        int n;
        while ((n = in.read(buf)) >= 0)
            out.write(buf, 0, n);
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use `try-with-resources` instead of `try-finally` for closable resources
- Resources must implement `AutoCloseable`
- Secondary exceptions are suppressed and available via `getSuppressed()`

---

## Chapter 3: Methods Common to All Objects

---

### Item 10: Obey the general contract when overriding equals

**The Problem:** Incorrect `equals` overrides can break collections and other code that depend on the equals contract, leading to subtle and hard-to-debug failures.

**The Rule:** Override `equals` only when a class has value semantics and a clear notion of logical equality. When you do, follow the five requirements: reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, consistency, and non-nullity.

Do not override `equals` when instances are inherently unique, there is no need for logical equality, a superclass's equals is appropriate, or the class is private and equals is never used. Common mistakes: interoperating with unrelated types breaks symmetry; subclasses adding value components break transitivity. Use composition instead of inheritance when adding value components. Use `instanceof` for type checking (not `getClass()`) to preserve Liskov Substitution. Always override `hashCode` when you override `equals`.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == this) return true;
    if (!(o instanceof PhoneNumber)) return false;
    PhoneNumber pn = (PhoneNumber) o;
    return pn.lineNum == lineNum && pn.prefix == prefix
        && pn.areaCode == areaCode;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Respect reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, consistency, and non-nullity
- Use `instanceof`, not `getClass()`, to preserve Liskov Substitution
- Use composition rather than inheritance when adding value components
- Always override `hashCode` when overriding `equals`

---

### Item 11: Always override hashCode when you override equals

**The Problem:** If `equals` is overridden but `hashCode` is not, equal objects may have different hash codes, breaking hash-based collections such as `HashMap` and `HashSet`.

**The Rule:** Override `hashCode` whenever you override `equals`. Equal objects must produce equal hash codes; unequal objects should ideally produce different hash codes to avoid collisions.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override public int hashCode() {
    int result = Short.hashCode(areaCode);
    result = 31 * result + Short.hashCode(prefix);
    result = 31 * result + Short.hashCode(lineNum);
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Must override `hashCode` whenever you override `equals`
- Equal objects must have equal hash codes
- Combine field hash codes with `31 * result + c`
- Use `Objects.hash()` only when performance is not critical

---

### Item 12: Always override toString

**The Problem:** The default `Object.toString()` returns something like `PhoneNumber@163b91`, which is not useful for debugging or logging.

**The Rule:** Override `toString` in every instantiable class unless a superclass already does. Return a concise, informative representation of the object's state.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override public String toString() {
    return String.format("%03d-%03d-%04d", areaCode, prefix, lineNum);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Override `toString` in every instantiable class
- Return a concise, informative representation
- Decide whether to specify format and document it
- Provide accessors instead of forcing clients to parse `toString`

---

### Item 13: Override clone judiciously

**The Problem:** `Cloneable` does not declare `clone`, relies on an implicit contract, and leads to fragile cloning logic and compatibility issues with `final` fields.

**The Rule:** Prefer copy constructors or copy factories over `clone`. If you implement `Cloneable`, follow the conventions: call `super.clone()`, fix mutable fields, and ensure the clone is independent.

`clone` can conflict with `final` fields and must never call overridable methods. Copy constructors (`Yum(Yum yum)`) and copy factories avoid these issues and can accept interfaces (e.g. `new TreeSet<>(collection)`).

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override public Stack clone() {
    try {
        Stack result = (Stack) super.clone();
        result.elements = elements.clone();
        return result;
    } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer copy constructors or copy factories over `Cloneable`/`clone`
- If you implement `Cloneable`, call `super.clone()` and fix mutable fields
- Arrays are one of the few good uses of `clone`

---

### Item 14: Consider implementing Comparable

**The Problem:** Value classes with a natural order benefit from interoperating with sorted collections and generic algorithms, but this requires a correct `compareTo` implementation.

**The Rule:** Implement `Comparable<T>` for value classes with a natural ordering. Ensure `compareTo` is consistent with `equals` when possible.

Use `Short.compare`, `Integer.compare`, etc., for primitives instead of `<`/`>` or subtraction (which can overflow). For multiple fields, compare in order of significance. Use `Comparator.comparingInt().thenComparingInt()` for multi-field comparisons.

**Code Example:**
```java
public int compareTo(PhoneNumber pn) {
    int result = Short.compare(areaCode, pn.areaCode);
    if (result == 0) {
        result = Short.compare(prefix, pn.prefix);
        if (result == 0)
            result = Short.compare(lineNum, pn.lineNum);
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Implement `Comparable` for value classes with a natural ordering
- Make `compareTo` consistent with `equals` when possible
- Use boxed primitive `compare` methods and `Comparator` factories
- Avoid subtraction-based comparators due to overflow

## Chapter 4: Classes and Interfaces

---

### Item 15: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members

**The Problem:** Poor design exposes internal data and implementation details. Components that leak their internals are harder to maintain, optimize, reuse, and reason about, and they couple parts of the system too tightly.

**The Rule:** Make each class or member as inaccessible as possible—use the lowest access level that still lets the software function correctly.

Information hiding (encapsulation) decouples components, speeds development (parallel work), eases maintenance and debugging, enables performance tuning without breaking correctness, promotes reuse, and reduces risk in large systems.

**Why it matters:**
- **Top-level classes/interfaces:** Use package-private when possible; public only when part of the exported API. Public types become a commitment to support indefinitely.
- **Members:** Prefer `private` by default. Use package-private only when needed within the package. Use `protected` sparingly—it is part of the exported API.
- **Testing:** Making members package-private for tests is acceptable; raising to public for tests is not. Tests can live in the same package.
- **Public fields:** Avoid public mutable fields; they break encapsulation, invariants, and thread safety. Public `static final` constants are allowed if they reference immutable values. Do not expose `static final` arrays; use an unmodifiable list or a method that returns a copy.
- **Modules (Java 9+):** Add implicit access levels, but module-based visibility is mostly advisory unless using the module path.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Potential security hole!
public static final Thing[] VALUES = { ... };

// Fix: use unmodifiable list or return a copy
private static final Thing[] PRIVATE_VALUES = { ... };
public static final List<Thing> VALUES =
    Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(PRIVATE_VALUES));
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use the lowest access level consistent with proper behavior.
- Keep package-private for implementation details.
- Reserve `protected` for rare cases.
- Avoid public mutable fields; ensure `public static final` fields reference immutable objects.

---

### Item 16: In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields

**The Problem:** Exposing fields directly in public classes removes encapsulation. You cannot change representation, enforce invariants, or run side effects on access.

**The Rule:** In public classes, hide data behind private fields and expose them through accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) for mutable types.

**Why it matters:**
- **Public classes:** Client code can depend on internal representation. Public fields make change nearly impossible.
- **Package-private/private nested classes:** Direct field access is acceptable when describing the abstraction and when changes stay within the package or enclosing class.
- **Immutable fields:** Public immutable fields are less bad than mutable ones, but still tie you to representation.
- **Point and Dimension:** Often cited as examples of the problems with exposed fields; `Dimension` has long-standing performance issues.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Encapsulation of data by accessor methods and mutators
class Point {
    private double x;
    private double y;
    public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    public double getX() { return x; }
    public double getY() { return y; }
    public void setX(double x) { this.x = x; }
    public void setY(double y) { this.y = y; }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Never expose mutable fields in public classes.
- Exposing immutable fields is less harmful but still ties you to representation.
- Package-private and private nested classes may use direct field access.

---

### Item 17: Minimize mutability

**The Problem:** Mutable classes are harder to design, use, and reason about. They cause more bugs and complicate concurrency.

**The Rule:** Make classes immutable unless there is a strong reason to make them mutable.

**Why it matters:**
- **Five rules for immutability:**  
  1. No mutators.  
  2. Prevent extension (e.g., `final`).  
  3. All fields `final`.  
  4. All fields `private`.  
  5. Defensive copying for mutable components.
- **Benefits:** Easier design, thread safety without synchronization, free sharing, no defensive copies, good for map keys and set elements, failure atomicity.
- **Functional style:** Return new instances (e.g., `plus`, `minus`) instead of mutating.
- **Performance:** May require a separate object per value; use mutable companions (e.g., `StringBuilder`) when needed.
- **Alternative to `final`:** Private constructors plus static factories for multiple implementations and caching.
- **Lazy initialization:** Non-final fields for caching are allowed if changes are invisible externally.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Immutable complex number class
public final class Complex {
    private final double re;
    private final double im;
    public Complex(double re, double im) { this.re = re; this.im = im; }
    public double realPart() { return re; }
    public double imaginaryPart() { return im; }
    public Complex plus(Complex c) {
        return new Complex(re + c.re, im + c.im);
    }
    public Complex minus(Complex c) {
        return new Complex(re - c.re, im - c.im);
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer immutability for value types.
- Use mutable companions only when performance demands it.
- Use private constructors and static factories to allow multiple implementations.

---

### Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance

**The Problem:** Inheritance across package boundaries violates encapsulation. Subclasses depend on superclass implementation details and can break when the superclass changes. Implementation inheritance is fragile.

**The Rule:** Prefer composition and forwarding over inheritance, especially when reusing behavior across package boundaries.

**Why it matters:**
- **Implementation details:** `HashSet.addAll` may call `add`; if both are overridden, `addCount` can be counted twice.
- **Superclass evolution:** New methods in the superclass can conflict with subclass methods (signatures or behavior).
- **Composition + forwarding:** Wrap the existing class and delegate; no dependence on implementation details.
- **Wrapper/Decorator:** Instrumentation, synchronization, etc., can be added without inheritance.
- **SELF problem:** Wrapper objects may be bypassed in callback frameworks.
- **“Is-a” rule:** Inheritance is appropriate only for true subtype relationships.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Wrapper class - uses composition in place of inheritance
public class InstrumentedSet<E> extends ForwardingSet<E> {
    private int addCount = 0;
    public InstrumentedSet(Set<E> s) { super(s); }
    @Override public boolean add(E e) { addCount++; return super.add(e); }
    @Override public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c) {
        addCount += c.size(); return super.addAll(c);
    }
    public int getAddCount() { return addCount; }
}
// ForwardingSet delegates all Set methods to the wrapped Set
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use inheritance only when there is a clear subtype relationship.
- For code reuse across packages, prefer composition and forwarding.
- Wrapper classes (decorators) are more robust and flexible.

---

### Item 19: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it

**The Problem:** Subclassing classes not designed for extension leads to fragile code. Undocumented self-use patterns and hidden hooks cause bugs and subtle failures.

**The Rule:** Either design and document a class for inheritance (including self-use and protected hooks) or prevent subclassing by making it `final` or using package-private constructors and static factories.

**Why it matters:**
- **Document self-use:** For each public/protected method, document which overridable methods it calls and how, using `@implSpec`.
- **Protected hooks:** Expose minimal protected members for subclasses.
- **Constructors:** Never invoke overridable methods from constructors; subclass state may not be initialized.
- **Cloneable / Serializable:** Special handling for `clone`, `readObject`, `readResolve`, `writeReplace`.
- **Prohibition:** Use `final` or private/package-private constructors with static factories when subclassing is not intended.
- **Wrapper pattern:** Prefer wrapping over subclassing when adding behavior.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Broken - constructor invokes an overridable method
public class Super {
    public Super() { overrideMe(); }
    public void overrideMe() { }
}
public final class Sub extends Super {
    private final Instant instant;
    Sub() { instant = Instant.now(); }
    @Override public void overrideMe() { System.out.println(instant); }
}
// overrideMe() prints null first time—Sub constructor hasn't run yet!
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Document self-use with `@implSpec`.
- Constructors must not call overridable methods.
- If not designed for inheritance, prohibit it.
- When designing for inheritance, keep protected surface minimal.

---

### Item 20: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes

**The Problem:** Abstract classes impose single inheritance and are harder to retrofit onto existing code. They do not support mixins or flexible, non-hierarchical type systems.

**The Rule:** Prefer interfaces for type definitions. Use abstract skeletal implementations (e.g., `AbstractList`) to reduce implementation burden.

**Why it matters:**
- **Retrofitting:** Existing classes can implement new interfaces; extending new abstract classes is often impractical.
- **Mixins:** Interfaces can declare optional behavior (e.g., `Comparable`); abstract classes cannot.
- **Non-hierarchical types:** Multiple interfaces (e.g., `Singer`, `Songwriter`) avoid combinatorial explosion.
- **Wrapper pattern:** Interfaces support the decorator/wrapper pattern.
- **Default methods (Java 8+):** Allow shared implementation on interfaces, with limits (no Object methods, no instance fields).
- **Skeletal implementations:** Abstract classes like `AbstractList` provide implementation help without forcing type constraints.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Skeletal implementation - Template Method pattern
public abstract class AbstractMapEntry<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
    @Override public V setValue(V value) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
    @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { /* ... */ }
    @Override public int hashCode() { /* ... */ }
    @Override public String toString() { return getKey() + "=" + getValue(); }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use interfaces for type definitions.
- Provide skeletal implementations alongside important interfaces.
- Default methods ease implementation but have restrictions.

---

### Item 21: Design interfaces for posterity

**The Problem:** Default methods let you add methods to interfaces, but implementations written before those methods existed may break. The risk is especially high for complex contracts.

**The Rule:** Design interfaces carefully from the start. Add default methods only when truly necessary, and assume some implementations may break.

**Why it matters:**
- **Default methods:** Injected into existing implementations; authors may not have anticipated them.
- **Example:** Apache `SynchronizedCollection` does not override `removeIf`; the default lacks synchronization.
- **Platform libraries:** Had to override `removeIf` to preserve synchronization.
- **Recommendation:** Add default methods only when critical; consider existing implementations.
- **Design process:** Test interfaces with multiple implementations and clients before release.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Default method added to Collection - breaks SynchronizedCollection
default boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(filter);
    boolean result = false;
    for (Iterator<E> it = iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
        if (filter.test(it.next())) {
            it.remove();
            result = true;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Interfaces are hard to change once released.
- Default methods can break existing implementations.
- Test interfaces thoroughly before release.
- Use default methods primarily when creating new interfaces.

---

### Item 22: Use interfaces only to define types

**The Problem:** Using interfaces for constants pollutes implementors’ APIs, couples them to implementation details, and commits them to maintaining the interface even when they no longer need the constants.

**The Rule:** Use interfaces only to define types (contracts). Do not use them to export constants.

**Why it matters:**
- **Constant interfaces:** Classes implementing them expose constants in their API; constants are implementation details.
- **Subclasses:** Inherit constant pollution.
- **Alternatives:** Add constants to the relevant class/interface; use enums; use a non-instantiable utility class; use static import for readability.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Constant utility class - preferred over constant interface
public class PhysicalConstants {
    private PhysicalConstants() { }
    public static final double AVOGADROS_NUMBER = 6.022_140_857e23;
    public static final double BOLTZMANN_CONSTANT = 1.380_648_52e-23;
    public static final double ELECTRON_MASS = 9.109_383_56e-31;
}
// Use static import: import static ...PhysicalConstants.*;
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Interfaces define types, not constants.
- Export constants from classes or utility classes.
- Use static import for frequent constant use.

---

### Item 23: Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes

**The Problem:** Tagged classes (classes with a tag field indicating variant) are verbose, error-prone, and inefficient. They mix variants in one class and force switch statements.

**The Rule:** Replace tagged classes with class hierarchies. Use an abstract base with one subclass per variant.

**Why it matters:**
- **Tagged classes:** Boilerplate, mixed implementations, wasted memory, non-final fields, easy to forget switch cases, no type-level indication of variant.
- **Hierarchies:** Clean separation, final fields, compiler checks, extensible.
- **Relationship modeling:** Reflect natural relationships (e.g., `Square extends Rectangle`).

**Code Example:**
```java
// Class hierarchy replacement for a tagged class
abstract class Figure {
    abstract double area();
}
class Circle extends Figure {
    final double radius;
    Circle(double radius) { this.radius = radius; }
    @Override double area() { return Math.PI * (radius * radius); }
}
class Rectangle extends Figure {
    final double length;
    final double width;
    Rectangle(double length, double width) {
        this.length = length; this.width = width;
    }
    @Override double area() { return length * width; }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Replace tagged classes with abstract base classes and subclasses.
- Avoid tag fields and switch-on-tag logic.
- Use type hierarchy to model variant relationships.

### Item 24: Favor static member classes over nonstatic

**The Problem:** Nonstatic member classes implicitly hold a reference to the enclosing instance, which consumes memory and can cause retention/garbage-collection issues.

**The Rule:** Use static member classes unless each instance needs a reference to the enclosing instance.

**Why it matters:**
- **Static member class:** Independent of enclosing instance; like a static field.
- **Nonstatic member class:** Has hidden reference to enclosing instance; used for adapters (e.g., iterators, Map views).
- **Memory:** Each nonstatic instance keeps the enclosing instance live.
- **Anonymous classes:** Use for one-off instances; keep short; prefer lambdas for function objects.
- **Local classes:** Similar to anonymous, but have names and can be reused.
- **Map entries:** Use `private static` so entries do not hold references to the map.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Typical use of a nonstatic member class - needs enclosing instance
public class MySet<E> extends AbstractSet<E> {
    @Override public Iterator<E> iterator() {
        return new MyIterator();
    }
    private class MyIterator implements Iterator<E> {
        // Needs access to enclosing MySet instance
    }
}
// Use static when no enclosing reference needed (e.g., Map.Entry)
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use static when the nested class does not need the enclosing instance.
- Nonstatic is for adapters (iterators, views) that need the enclosing instance.
- Avoid unnecessary retention of enclosing instances.

---

### Item 25: Limit source files to a single top-level class

**The Problem:** Multiple top-level classes in one file can lead to multiple definitions for the same class. Which definition is used depends on compile order, causing non-deterministic behavior.

**The Rule:** Put at most one top-level class or interface per source file.

**Why it matters:**
- **Compilation order:** Different `javac` order can produce different outputs.
- **Example:** `Utensil.java` and `Dessert.java` both defining `Utensil` and `Dessert` with different values.
- **Alternative:** Use static member classes when several types belong together.
- **Benefits:** Single-definition guarantee, consistent behavior regardless of compile order.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Two classes in one file - DON'T DO THIS
// Utensil.java:
class Utensil { static final String NAME = "pan"; }
class Dessert { static final String NAME = "cake"; }

// Dessert.java (another file with same class names - conflict!):
class Utensil { static final String NAME = "pot"; }
class Dessert { static final String NAME = "pie"; }
// Result depends on compile order!
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- One top-level class or interface per source file.
- Use static member classes for closely related helper types.
- Avoid order-dependent compilation behavior.

## Chapter 5: Generics

---

### Item 26: Don't use raw types

**The Problem:** Raw types bypass the generic type system. Mistakes (wrong types in collections) surface at runtime as `ClassCastException` instead of compile time.

**The Rule:** Do not use raw types such as `List` or `Set`. Use parameterized types (`List<String>`) or unbounded wildcards (`Set<?>`) instead.

**Why it matters:**
- **Raw types:** Generic type information is erased; you lose safety and expressiveness.
- **Parameterized types:** Compiler checks and inserts casts.
- **List vs List<Object>:** `List` opts out; `List<Object>` explicitly allows any type. You cannot pass `List<String>` to `List<Object>`.
- **Set<?> vs Set:** Wildcard is safe; raw type is not. With `Set<?>` you cannot insert non-null elements; with raw `Set` you can corrupt the collection.
- **Exceptions:** Use raw types for `instanceof` and class literals (`List.class`, not `List<String>.class`).
- **Migration compatibility:** Raw types exist for legacy interoperability, not for new code.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Raw collection type - don't do this!
private final Collection stamps = ...;
stamps.add(new Coin(...));  // Compiles! Runtime error later

// Parameterized - compile-time safety
private final Collection<Stamp> stamps = ...;
stamps.add(new Coin(...));  // Compile error

// Unbounded wildcard for unknown element type
static int numElementsInCommon(Set<?> s1, Set<?> s2) { ... }
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use parameterized types for known element types.
- Use unbounded wildcards (`Set<?>`) when the type is unknown.
- Use raw types only for `instanceof` and class literals.
- Avoid raw types in new code.

---

### Item 27: Eliminate unchecked warnings

**The Problem:** Unchecked warnings point to potential runtime `ClassCastException`s. Ignoring them hides real type-safety issues; suppressing them without proof introduces risk.

**The Rule:** Fix every unchecked warning that you can. If you must suppress, prove type safety first and use `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` in the narrowest scope with a comment explaining why.

**Why it matters:**
- **Types of warnings:** Unchecked cast, unchecked method invocation, unchecked parameterized vararg, unchecked conversion.
- **Fixing:** Often as simple as adding type parameters or diamond operator.
- **Suppressing:** Only when you can prove safety; document the rationale.
- **Scope:** Apply to the smallest declaration (variable, short method), never to a whole class.
- **Example:** `ArrayList.toArray`—suppress on the local variable holding the cast result, not the whole method.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Adding local variable to reduce scope of @SuppressWarnings
public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a) {
    if (a.length < size) {
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") T[] result =
            (T[]) Arrays.copyOf(elements, size, a.getClass());
        return result;
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Treat unchecked warnings seriously.
- Fix them when possible; suppress only with proof and minimal scope.
- Always document why suppression is safe.

---

### Item 28: Prefer lists to arrays

**The Problem:** Arrays and generics have different type rules. Arrays are covariant and reified; generics are invariant and erased. Mixing them causes compile errors and hidden runtime failures.

**The Rule:** Prefer `List<E>` over `E[]` when working with generics, especially in APIs and generic types.

**Why it matters:**
- **Covariance:** `Sub[]` is a subtype of `Super[]`; `List<Sub>` is not a subtype of `List<Super>`.
- **Arrays:** Detect wrong-element-type stores at runtime (`ArrayStoreException`).
- **Generics:** Detect them at compile time.
- **Reification vs erasure:** Arrays know element type at runtime; generics do not.
- **Generic arrays:** `new List<E>[]`, `new E[]` are illegal because of type safety.
- **Varargs:** Varargs creates arrays; generic varargs can cause heap pollution (Item 32).
- **Practical fix:** Replace arrays with lists inside generic types (e.g., Chooser, Stack).

**Code Example:**
```java
// Fails at runtime - arrays are covariant
Object[] objectArray = new Long[1];
objectArray[0] = "I don't fit in";  // ArrayStoreException

// Won't compile - generics are invariant
List<Object> ol = new ArrayList<Long>();  // Incompatible types

// List-based Chooser - typesafe
public class Chooser<T> {
    private final List<T> choiceList;
    public Chooser(Collection<T> choices) {
        choiceList = new ArrayList<>(choices);
    }
    public T choose() {
        return choiceList.get(rnd.nextInt(choiceList.size()));
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer `List<E>` to `E[]` in generic code.
- Arrays and generics interact poorly.
- Use lists to avoid unchecked casts and generic array creation.

---

### Item 29: Favor generic types

**The Problem:** Non-generic types force casts in client code and can lead to `ClassCastException` at runtime.

**The Rule:** Parameterize classes (and interfaces) that could benefit from type parameters so clients can use them without casts.

**Why it matters:**
- **Generic array creation:** Cannot use `new E[]`; use `(E[]) new Object[]` with `@SuppressWarnings` or `Object[]` with casts on read.
- **Two techniques:** Cast at creation (single cast, some heap pollution) vs cast on each read (no heap pollution, more casts).
- **Bounds:** Use `E extends Delayed` when the type must support specific operations.
- **Primitives:** No `Stack<int>`; use boxed types (Item 61).
- **Backward compatibility:** Generifying existing types usually does not break clients.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Generic Stack - first technique: cast array at creation
public class Stack<E> {
    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public Stack() {
        elements = (E[]) new Object[DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY];
    }
    private E[] elements;
    public void push(E e) { ... }
    public E pop() { ... }
}

// Bounded type parameter example
class DelayQueue<E extends Delayed> implements BlockingQueue<E>
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Make types generic when they can benefit from type parameters.
- Prefer cast-at-creation over cast-on-read for backing arrays when safe.
- Add bounds when the type parameter must support certain operations.

---

### Item 30: Favor generic methods

**The Problem:** Non-generic utility methods force raw types or unnecessary casts for callers.

**The Rule:** Make static utility methods generic when they operate on parameterized types, and use type parameters to eliminate casts and preserve type safety.

**Why it matters:**
- **Declaration:** Type parameter list goes between modifiers and return type: `<E> Set<E>`.
- **Generic singleton:** Use a single instance for all type parameterizations (e.g., `identityFunction()`); erasure makes this possible.
- **Recursive type bound:** `<E extends Comparable<E>>` for “mutually comparable” elements.
- **Example:** `Collections.binarySearch`, `Collections.sort` are generic.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Generic method
public static <E> Set<E> union(Set<E> s1, Set<E> s2) {
    Set<E> result = new HashSet<>(s1);
    result.addAll(s2);
    return result;
}

// Generic singleton factory
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public static <T> UnaryOperator<T> identityFunction() {
    return (UnaryOperator<T>) IDENTITY_FN;
}

// Recursive type bound
public static <E extends Comparable<E>> E max(Collection<E> c) {
    if (c.isEmpty()) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Empty collection");
    E result = null;
    for (E e : c)
        if (result == null || e.compareTo(result) > 0)
            result = Objects.requireNonNull(e);
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Make utility methods generic when they work with parameterized types.
- Use recursive type bounds for mutually comparable types.
- Consider generic singleton factories for stateless objects.

---

### Item 31: Use bounded wildcards to increase API flexibility

**The Problem:** Parameterized types are invariant. `List<String>` is not a subtype of `List<Object>`, which restricts what methods can accept.

**The Rule:** Use bounded wildcards on input parameters: `? extends T` for producers, `? super T` for consumers (PECS: Producer-Extends, Consumer-Super).

**Why it matters:**
- **Producer-extends:** `pushAll(Iterable<? extends E>)` accepts `Iterable<Integer>` for `Stack<Number>`.
- **Consumer-super:** `popAll(Collection<? super E>)` accepts `Collection<Object>` for `Stack<Number>`.
- **Exact match:** When a parameter is both producer and consumer, use exact type.
- **Return types:** Do not use wildcards; they force clients to use wildcards.
- **Comparable/Comparator:** Prefer `Comparable<? super T>` and `Comparator<? super T>`.
- **Wildcard capture:** Use a private generic helper when you need to capture a wildcard (e.g., swap).

**Code Example:**
```java
// Producer - extends
public void pushAll(Iterable<? extends E> src) {
    for (E e : src) push(e);
}

// Consumer - super
public void popAll(Collection<? super E> dst) {
    while (!isEmpty()) dst.add(pop());
}

// Wildcard capture via helper
public static void swap(List<?> list, int i, int j) {
    swapHelper(list, i, j);
}
private static <E> void swapHelper(List<E> list, int i, int j) {
    list.set(i, list.set(j, list.get(i)));
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- PECS: Producer-extends, Consumer-super.
- Use `Comparable<? super T>`, `Comparator<? super T>`.
- Don’t use wildcards in return types.
- Use helper methods for wildcard capture when needed.

---

### Item 32: Combine generics and varargs judiciously

**The Problem:** Varargs creates arrays; generic arrays are problematic. Varargs with generic or parameterized types can cause heap pollution and confusing warnings.

**The Rule:** Use generic varargs only when safe. Annotate safe methods with `@SafeVarargs`. Ensure the varargs array is not modified and not exposed to untrusted code.

**Why it matters:**
- **Heap pollution:** A variable of parameterized type refers to an object of the wrong type; invisible casts can fail.
- **Varargs method:** Creates an array; with non-reifiable types, you get warnings.
- **Safety:** Safe if you do not store into the varargs array and do not expose it (except to properly annotated varargs or non-varargs methods that only read).
- **Danger:** Returning the varargs array (e.g., `toArray`) can propagate pollution up the call stack.
- **@SafeVarargs:** Suppresses client warnings; use only on methods that cannot be overridden (static, final instance, or private instance in Java 9+).
- **Alternative:** Use `List` parameters instead of varargs for type safety.

**Code Example:**
```java
// UNSAFE - exposes generic parameter array
static <T> T[] toArray(T... args) { return args; }

// Safe method with @SafeVarargs
@SafeVarargs
static <T> List<T> flatten(List<? extends T>... lists) {
    List<T> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (List<? extends T> list : lists)
        result.addAll(list);
    return result;
}

// List-based alternative - provably typesafe
static <T> List<T> flatten(List<List<? extends T>> lists) {
    List<T> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (List<? extends T> list : lists)
        result.addAll(list);
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Generic varargs can cause heap pollution.
- Use `@SafeVarargs` only when the method is provably safe.
- Consider `List` parameters instead of varargs.
- Never store into or expose the varargs array unsafely.

---

### Item 33: Consider typesafe heterogeneous containers

**The Problem:** Standard generics limit you to a fixed number of type parameters per container (e.g., `Set<E>`, `Map<K,V>`). Some designs need a variable number of type parameters.

**The Rule:** Use the key as the type parameter instead of the container. Use `Class<T>` (or similar) as a typesafe key, so the value’s type matches the key.

**Why it matters:**
- **Favorites pattern:** Map `Class<T>` to `T`; `putFavorite(Class<T>, T)` and `getFavorite(Class<T>)` return `T`.
- **Type token:** `Class` used to pass compile-time and runtime type information.
- **Implementation:** Store `Map<Class<?>, Object>`, use `Class.cast()` on retrieval.
- **Runtime safety:** Use `type.cast(instance)` in `putFavorite` to enforce correctness.
- **Limitation:** Cannot store non-reifiable types (e.g., `List<String>`) because `List<String>.class` is illegal.
- **Bounded type tokens:** `Class<? extends Annotation>` for annotation access; use `asSubclass` to safely cast `Class<?>`.
- **Checked collections:** `Collections.checkedSet`, `checkedList`, etc., add runtime type checking.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Typesafe heterogeneous container
public class Favorites {
    private Map<Class<?>, Object> favorites = new HashMap<>();
    public <T> void putFavorite(Class<T> type, T instance) {
        favorites.put(Objects.requireNonNull(type), instance);
    }
    public <T> T getFavorite(Class<T> type) {
        return type.cast(favorites.get(type));
    }
}
// Usage
Favorites f = new Favorites();
f.putFavorite(String.class, "Java");
f.putFavorite(Integer.class, 0xcafebabe);
String s = f.getFavorite(String.class);  // "Java"
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use key-level parameterization for heterogeneous containers.
- Use `Class<T>` as a type token for type-safe storage and retrieval.
- Use `Class.cast()` to avoid unchecked casts.
- Non-reifiable types (e.g., `List<String>`) cannot be keys.
- Use bounded type tokens and `asSubclass` for annotation-style APIs.

# Effective Java 3rd Edition: Items 34-48

## Chapter 6: Enums and Annotations

### Item 34: Use enums instead of int constants

**The Problem:** Before enum types existed in Java, programmers used the int enum pattern—declaring groups of named `int` constants—to represent enumerated types. This approach lacks type safety, allows nonsensical operations (like passing an apple to a method expecting an orange), provides no printable strings, has no namespace isolation, causes brittleness when values change (clients must be recompiled), and cannot iterate over all constants. The String enum variant is worse: it encourages hard-coding strings in client code, leading to typos that escape compile-time detection and potential performance issues from string comparisons.

**The Rule:** Use Java's enum type whenever you need a set of constants whose members are known at compile time. Enums provide full type safety, rich behavior, and many benefits that int and String constants cannot offer.

Java enums are full-fledged classes, not mere int values like in C/C++. Each enum exports one instance per constant via `public static final` fields. Enum types are instance-controlled and effectively final—clients cannot create instances or extend them. They implement `Comparable` and `Serializable` automatically, provide high-quality `Object` method implementations, and support iteration via `values()`. You can associate data and methods with enum constants, use constant-specific class bodies for different behaviors per constant, and employ the strategy enum pattern when constants share behaviors. Prefer constant-specific method implementations over switch-on-enum when implementing behavior, as switches are fragile: forgetting a case compiles but fails at runtime. Use the strategy enum pattern (passing a strategy enum to the constructor) when some constants share behavior. Override `toString` for custom representations; consider a `fromString` method when you do. Enum constructors cannot access static fields (they aren't initialized yet) or other enum constants. Performance is comparable to int constants; the minor load/initialization cost is rarely noticeable.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Enum type with data and behavior
public enum Planet {
    MERCURY(3.302e+23, 2.439e6),
    VENUS(4.869e+24, 6.052e6),
    EARTH(5.975e+24, 6.378e6),
    MARS(6.419e+23, 3.393e6),
    JUPITER(1.899e+27, 7.149e7),
    SATURN(5.685e+26, 6.027e7),
    URANUS(8.683e+25, 2.556e7),
    NEPTUNE(1.024e+26, 2.477e7);
    private final double mass;
    private final double radius;
    private final double surfaceGravity;
    private static final double G = 6.67300E-11;
    Planet(double mass, double radius) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.radius = radius;
        surfaceGravity = G * mass / (radius * radius);
    }
    public double surfaceWeight(double mass) {
        return mass * surfaceGravity;
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Enums provide compile-time type safety and prevent cross-type misuse
- Use constant-specific class bodies for different behavior per constant
- Use the strategy enum pattern when constants share behavior
- Avoid switch-on-enum for implementing behavior—use it only to augment enums you don't control
- Store associated values in instance fields, never derive them from `ordinal()`
- Enum constructors run in a static context; they cannot access static fields or other constants

---

### Item 35: Use instance fields instead of ordinals

**The Problem:** Every enum has an `ordinal()` method returning the numerical position of each constant. Programmers may be tempted to derive associated int values from it (e.g., `return ordinal() + 1` for ensemble size). This is fragile: reordering constants breaks the logic, you cannot have two constants share the same int value (e.g., octet and double quartet both have 8 musicians), and you cannot skip values (e.g., adding triple quartet at 12 forces you to add a dummy constant for 11). The ordinal's relationship to your domain is coincidental and easily broken by maintenance.

**The Rule:** Never derive a value associated with an enum from its ordinal; store the value in an instance field instead. The `ordinal` method is intended for use by general-purpose enum-based data structures like `EnumSet` and `EnumMap`—application programmers should avoid it.

**Code Example:**
```java
public enum Ensemble {
    SOLO(1), DUET(2), TRIO(3), QUARTET(4), QUINTET(5),
    SEXTET(6), SEPTET(7), OCTET(8), DOUBLE_QUARTET(8),
    NONET(9), DECTET(10), TRIPLE_QUARTET(12);
    private final int numberOfMusicians;
    Ensemble(int size) { this.numberOfMusicians = size; }
    public int numberOfMusicians() { return numberOfMusicians; }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- `ordinal()` is for `EnumSet`/`EnumMap` and similar infrastructure—not for application logic
- Explicit instance fields make intent clear and survive reordering and shared values
- Avoid `ordinal()` entirely unless you are writing enum-based generic data structures

---

### Item 36: Use EnumSet instead of bit fields

**The Problem:** When enum elements are used primarily in sets, the traditional approach was the bit field: assigning powers of 2 to each constant and combining them with bitwise OR. Bit fields inherit all disadvantages of int enums (no type safety, poor printability) plus additional issues: harder to interpret when printed, no easy iteration over elements, and you must predict maximum bit width (typically int or long) at API design time. Once chosen, you cannot exceed 32 or 64 bits without changing the API.

**The Rule:** Use `EnumSet` instead of bit fields to represent sets of enum values. It provides type safety, rich `Set` operations, and interoperability with other collections, while internally using a bit vector (or single long for ≤64 elements) for performance comparable to bit fields.

**Code Example:**
```java
// EnumSet - a modern replacement for bit fields
public class Text {
    public enum Style { BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINE, STRIKETHROUGH }
    public void applyStyles(Set<Style> styles) { ... }
}
// Client code:
text.applyStyles(EnumSet.of(Style.BOLD, Style.ITALIC));
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Accept `Set<Style>` in APIs, not `EnumSet<Style>`, per Item 64 (program to interfaces)
- EnumSet has no immutable variant as of Java 9; use `Collections.unmodifiableSet` if needed
- EnumSet provides bit-field performance with enum and Set benefits

---

### Item 37: Use EnumMap instead of ordinal indexing

**The Problem:** Code that uses `ordinal()` to index into arrays or lists is error-prone: arrays are incompatible with generics (unchecked casts), array indices provide no type safety, wrong indices cause silent incorrect behavior or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, and multidimensional ordinal indexing (e.g., phase transition tables) scales poorly and is hard to maintain. Adding new enum constants requires manual array updates; mistakes compile but fail at runtime.

**The Rule:** Use `EnumMap` instead of ordinal-indexed arrays when associating data with enum keys. For multidimensional relationships (e.g., from-phase × to-phase → transition), use nested `EnumMap` (`EnumMap<Phase, EnumMap<Phase, Transition>>`). With streams, use the three-parameter `groupingBy` to specify `EnumMap` as the map factory.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Using an EnumMap to associate data with an enum
Map<Plant.LifeCycle, Set<Plant>> plantsByLifeCycle =
    new EnumMap<>(Plant.LifeCycle.class);
for (Plant.LifeCycle lc : Plant.LifeCycle.values())
    plantsByLifeCycle.put(lc, new HashSet<>());
for (Plant p : garden)
    plantsByLifeCycle.get(p.lifeCycle).add(p);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- EnumMap provides type safety and hides ordinal indexing internally
- With streams: `groupingBy(p -> p.lifeCycle, () -> new EnumMap<>(LifeCycle.class), toSet())`
- Never use ordinals for application logic; reserve them for EnumSet/EnumMap internals

---

### Item 38: Emulate extensible enums with interfaces

**The Problem:** Java enums are not extensible—you cannot have one enum extend another. Extensibility was possible with the legacy typesafe enum pattern but was intentionally omitted from the language: it confuses type relationships, complicates enumeration over base + extensions, and complicates design. However, some use cases (e.g., operation codes / opcodes) benefit from letting API users provide their own operations.

**The Rule:** Emulate extensible enums by defining an interface for the opcode/operation type and an enum that implements it. APIs should accept the interface type, not the implementation. Clients can define their own enums implementing the interface and use them wherever the base enum is expected.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Emulated extensible enum using an interface
public interface Operation {
    double apply(double x, double y);
}
public enum BasicOperation implements Operation {
    PLUS("+") { public double apply(double x, double y) { return x + y; } },
    MINUS("-") { public double apply(double x, double y) { return x - y; } },
    TIMES("*") { public double apply(double x, double y) { return x * y; } },
    DIVIDE("/") { public double apply(double x, double y) { return x / y; } };
    private final String symbol;
    BasicOperation(String symbol) { this.symbol = symbol; }
    @Override public String toString() { return symbol; }
}
public enum ExtendedOperation implements Operation {
    EXP("^") { public double apply(double x, double y) { return Math.pow(x, y); } },
    REMAINDER("%") { public double apply(double x, double y) { return x % y; } };
    private final String symbol;
    ExtendedOperation(String symbol) { this.symbol = symbol; }
    @Override public String toString() { return symbol; }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- APIs must be written in terms of the interface type, not the enum implementation
- Use `<T extends Enum<T> & Operation> Class<T>` as a bounded type token when iterating over extension enum types
- Passing `Collection<? extends Operation>` is an alternative that allows mixing operations from multiple implementations but forgoes EnumSet/EnumMap
- Shared implementation can go in the interface (default methods) or helper classes

---

### Item 39: Prefer annotations to naming patterns

**The Problem:** Historically, tools and frameworks used naming patterns (e.g., JUnit 3's `test` prefix for test methods). Naming patterns cause silent failures on typos, cannot restrict application to appropriate elements (e.g., class vs method), and provide no way to associate parameters (e.g., expected exception type) with program elements. The compiler cannot validate patterns.

**The Rule:** Use annotations instead of naming patterns when tools require programmers to add metadata to source code. Annotations provide compile-time checking, can be restricted to specific program elements via `@Target`, and support parameters. Use `@Retention(RUNTIME)` for runtime processing, and `@Repeatable` for multiple instances of the same annotation on one element (with a containing annotation type).

**Code Example:**
```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface ExceptionTest {
    Class<? extends Throwable> value();
}
@ExceptionTest(ArithmeticException.class)
public static void m1() {
    int i = 0;
    i = i / i;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Marker annotations have no parameters; parameterized annotations use `Class<? extends Throwable>` for exception types
- For repeatable annotations, check both the annotation type and its container with `isAnnotationPresent`; use `getAnnotationsByType` for access
- Define annotation types for tool/framework metadata; use predefined annotations (e.g., @Override) and those from IDEs/static analyzers

---

### Item 40: Consistently use the Override annotation

**The Problem:** Overloading `equals` instead of overriding it—using `equals(Bigram b)` instead of `equals(Object o)`—is a common mistake. The compiler will not catch it, and you inherit `Object.equals`, which tests identity. The result can be subtle bugs (e.g., a Set holding 260 elements instead of 26).

**The Rule:** Use `@Override` on every method you believe overrides a supertype declaration. The compiler will flag overloads and signature mismatches. The only exception: in concrete classes, you need not annotate overrides of abstract methods (the compiler already enforces those), but annotating them is harmless and can improve clarity.

**Code Example:**
```java
@Override public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof Bigram)) return false;
    Bigram b = (Bigram) o;
    return b.first == first && b.second == second;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- @Override catches accidental overloading and signature errors at compile time
- Use it for overrides of interface methods too, especially with default methods
- IDEs can insert @Override automatically and warn when it's missing on true overrides

---

### Item 41: Use marker interfaces to define types

**The Problem:** Marker annotations are sometimes suggested as replacements for marker interfaces (e.g., `Serializable`). However, marker interfaces define a type implemented by the marked class; marker annotations do not. Without the type, you cannot catch errors at compile time—only at runtime. Marker interfaces also allow more precise targeting: a marker interface can extend another interface, guaranteeing all marked types are subtypes of that interface.

**The Rule:** Use a marker interface when you want to define a type and might write methods that accept only objects with that marking. Use a marker annotation when the marker applies to non-class/interface elements or fits an annotation-based framework. If a marker annotation has `ElementType.TYPE`, consider whether a marker interface would be more appropriate.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Serializable is a marker interface - defines a type for compile-time checks
public interface Serializable { }
// A marker interface can extend another for precise targeting
public interface SomeRestrictedMarker extends SomeInterface { }
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Marker interfaces provide compile-time type checking; annotations do not
- Marker interfaces can extend another interface for precise applicability
- Choose marker interface when you need a type; choose annotation for frameworks and non-type targets

## Chapter 7: Lambdas and Streams

### Item 42: Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes

**The Problem:** Before Java 8, function objects were created with anonymous classes. They work but are verbose and made functional programming in Java unattractive. Anonymous classes are still useful for non-functional interfaces, abstract classes, and when the function object needs a reference to itself (`this`).

**The Rule:** Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes for small function objects. Lambdas are more succinct; the compiler infers types from context. Omit parameter types unless needed for clarity. Use generic types (List<String>, not raw List) so the compiler can perform type inference. Keep lambdas short—one line ideal, three lines max. For complex, multi-line, or stateful logic, use constant-specific class bodies in enums or extract to named methods. Do not serialize lambdas or anonymous classes; use private static nested classes for serializable comparators.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Lambda expression as function object (replaces anonymous class)
Collections.sort(words, (s1, s2) -> Integer.compare(s1.length(), s2.length()));
// Even more succinct with method reference:
words.sort(comparingInt(String::length));
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Lambdas replace anonymous classes for functional interfaces
- Lambdas lack names and docs; keep them short and self-explanatory
- Anonymous classes are still needed for abstract classes, multiple-method interfaces, and self-references
- Type inference depends on generics; raw types break lambda inference

---

### Item 43: Prefer method references to lambdas

**The Problem:** Lambdas eliminate boilerplate compared to anonymous classes, but they can still be verbose when they merely forward to an existing method. Method references are often shorter and clearer. However, sometimes a lambda is clearer—for example, when the lambda is in the same class as the referenced method, or when parameter names document intent better.

**The Rule:** Prefer method references where they are shorter and clearer; otherwise use lambdas. Method references come in five forms: static, bound instance, unbound instance, class constructor, and array constructor. When a lambda is shorter or more readable (e.g., `() -> action()` vs `GoshThisClassNameIsHumongous::action`), prefer the lambda. Use `x -> x` instead of `Function.identity()`.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Lambda
map.merge(key, 1, (count, incr) -> count + incr);
// Method reference - shorter and clearer
map.merge(key, 1, Integer::sum);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Method references eliminate boilerplate when they map directly to existing methods
- Five kinds: Static, Bound, Unbound, Class constructor, Array constructor
- Extract complex lambdas into named methods and use method references when it helps readability

---

### Item 44: Favor the use of standard functional interfaces

**The Problem:** Before lambdas, the Template Method pattern was common. Now, APIs increasingly accept function objects. Choosing the right functional interface matters: custom interfaces add conceptual surface area and miss interoperability. However, some interfaces (e.g., `Comparator`) deserve to exist despite structural overlap with standard ones.

**The Rule:** Use standard functional interfaces from `java.util.function` when they fit. The six basic interfaces are: `UnaryOperator<T>`, `BinaryOperator<T>`, `Predicate<T>`, `Function<T,R>`, `Supplier<T>`, and `Consumer<T>`. Use primitive variants (e.g., `IntPredicate`, `LongBinaryOperator`) instead of boxed primitives for performance. Write custom interfaces when you need a descriptive name, a strong contract, or custom default methods. Always annotate functional interfaces with `@FunctionalInterface`. Avoid overloading methods with different functional interfaces in the same argument position to prevent client casting.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Use standard BiPredicate instead of custom interface
protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry<K,V> eldest) {
    return size() > 100;
}
// BiPredicate<Map<K,V>, Map.Entry<K,V>> for constructor parameter
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Six basic interfaces: Operator (same in/out), Predicate, Function, Supplier, Consumer
- Use primitive variants; avoid boxed primitives in bulk operations
- Write custom interfaces when name, contract, or default methods add value
- @FunctionalInterface documents intent and enforces single abstract method

---

### Item 45: Use streams judiciously

**The Problem:** The streams API can express almost any computation, but overuse harms readability and maintainability. Stream pipelines use function objects (lambdas) that cannot read/modify enclosing mutable state, return from the enclosing method, or break/continue loops. Iterative code can do all of these. Streams excel at uniform transformations, filtering, combining, accumulating into collections, and searching—but not at accessing corresponding elements from multiple pipeline stages simultaneously.

**The Rule:** Use streams when they make code shorter and clearer; use iteration when it does. Prefer a combination of both for moderately complex tasks. Do not convert all loops to streams. Use helper methods with descriptive names in pipelines. Be wary of char processing: `chars()` returns `IntStream`, not `Stream<Character>`. Name lambda parameters carefully. For Cartesian products and similar tasks, both iterative and stream versions are acceptable; choose based on team preference and readability. When mapping loses earlier-stage values, consider inverting the mapping when you need them.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Tasteful use of streams
try (Stream<String> words = Files.lines(dictionary)) {
    words.collect(groupingBy(word -> alphabetize(word)))
        .values().stream()
        .filter(group -> group.size() >= minGroupSize)
        .forEach(g -> System.out.println(g.size() + ": " + g));
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Streams are lazy; no terminal operation means no computation
- Use helper methods; avoid inline complexity in pipelines
- Streams don't support char well; `chars()` returns ints
- Match the paradigm to the task; many programs benefit from mixing streams and iteration

---

### Item 46: Prefer side-effect-free functions in streams

**The Problem:** Streams are a paradigm, not just an API. To get expressiveness, performance, and parallelizability, you must structure computations as pure transformations. Using `forEach` to mutate external state (e.g., building a frequency map) is iterative code disguised as stream code—it derives no benefit, is harder to read, and is not amenable to parallelization.

**The Rule:** Pass side-effect-free function objects to all stream operations. Use collectors for reduction (e.g., `groupingBy`, `toMap`, `counting`) instead of mutating state in `forEach`. Use `forEach` only to report results, not to perform computation. Learn the core collectors: `toList`, `toSet`, `toCollection`, `toMap`, `groupingBy`, `joining`. Use the three-parameter `groupingBy` to specify map/collection types (e.g., EnumMap). Use `toMap` with a merge function for key collisions. Avoid `collect(counting())`; use `count()` on the stream.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Proper use of streams to initialize a frequency table
Map<String, Long> freq;
try (Stream<String> words = new Scanner(file).tokens()) {
    freq = words.collect(groupingBy(String::toLowerCase, counting()));
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Pure functions: result depends only on input; no mutable state
- forEach should report results, not perform computation
- Use collectors: groupingBy, toMap, counting, toList, toSet, joining
- Side-effect-free code enables correctness and parallelization

---

### Item 47: Prefer Collection to Stream as a return type

**The Problem:** `Stream` does not extend `Iterable`, so you cannot use a stream in a for-each loop directly. Users who want iteration are frustrated by stream-only APIs; users who want stream pipelines are frustrated by Iterable-only APIs. Adapter methods work but clutter client code. `Collection` extends `Iterable` and has `stream()`, so it supports both iteration and stream access.

**The Rule:** For public APIs returning sequences, prefer `Collection` (or a subtype like `List`, `Set`) when feasible—it supports both iteration and streams. Return a stream when the sequence is large or infinite, or when a custom collection would be complex. For very large/unbounded sequences, consider a custom `Collection` implementation (e.g., power set via `AbstractList`) or return `Stream`/`Iterable`. `Collection` constrains size to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`; for larger sequences, use stream or iterable. Provide both overloads (stream and iterable) only when justified.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Adapter from Stream to Iterable
public static <E> Iterable<E> iterableOf(Stream<E> stream) {
    return stream::iterator;
}
// Adapter from Iterable to Stream
public static <E> Stream<E> streamOf(Iterable<E> iterable) {
    return StreamSupport.stream(iterable.spliterator(), false);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Collection supports both for-each and stream(); use it when the sequence fits in memory
- For large/infinite sequences, return Stream or Iterable
- Custom Collection implementations (e.g., power set) can avoid materializing huge data
- Adapters exist but add clutter; prefer returning the right type from the API

---

### Item 48: Use caution when making streams parallel

**The Problem:** Adding `parallel()` to a stream pipeline is easy, but it can cause liveness failures (infinite loops, 100% CPU), safety failures (wrong results from non-associative/non-stateless functions), and severe performance degradation. Sources like `Stream.iterate` and operations like `limit` are poorly suited to parallelization. The default strategy may process far more elements than needed (e.g., for Mersenne primes, each prime costs roughly twice the previous), crippling performance.

**The Rule:** Do not parallelize stream pipelines indiscriminately. Use parallelism only when you have good reason to believe it preserves correctness and improves performance. Prefer streams over `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, arrays, and int/long ranges—they split well via spliterators. Use reduction-style terminal operations (reduce, min, max, count, sum) and avoid costly mutable reductions (collect). Ensure function objects are associative, non-interfering, and stateless. Use `forEachOrdered` if order matters with parallel streams. Measure performance before and after. As a rough guide, elements × lines-per-element should be at least 100,000 to justify parallelization. For random numbers, use `SplittableRandom`, not `Random` or `ThreadLocalRandom`.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Prime-counting - benefits from parallelization (efficient source, reduction)
static long pi(long n) {
    return LongStream.rangeClosed(2, n)
        .parallel()
        .mapToObj(BigInteger::valueOf)
        .filter(i -> i.isProbablePrime(50))
        .count();
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- parallel() can cause liveness failures, safety failures, and performance disasters
- Good sources: ArrayList, HashMap, arrays, int/long ranges; bad: Stream.iterate, limit-heavy pipelines
- Function objects must be associative, non-interfering, stateless for parallel correctness
- Always measure; parallelization is a performance optimization that must be validated
# Effective Java 3rd Edition — Items 49–77

## Chapter 8: Methods

---

### Item 49: Check parameters for validity

**The Problem:** Invalid parameter values can cause methods to fail in confusing ways—with misleading exceptions deep in processing, silent wrong results, or worst of all, leaving objects in corrupted states that cause failures at unrelated times and places. Without early validation, errors are harder to detect and debug.

**The Rule:** Document all parameter restrictions and enforce them with explicit checks at the start of the method body. Detect errors as soon as possible after they occur.

Most methods and constructors impose restrictions on parameters (e.g., non-negative indices, non-null references). Document these in Javadoc and validate them at the beginning of the method. Failure to do so can violate failure atomicity (Item 76)—objects may be left in inconsistent states. For public and protected methods, use `@throws` tags for `IllegalArgumentException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, or `NullPointerException`. Prefer `Objects.requireNonNull` for null checks and the `Objects.checkIndex` family (Java 9+) for index validation. For non-public methods, use assertions since you control the callers. Parameters stored for later use (especially constructor parameters) require extra scrutiny. Exceptions: skip explicit checks when validation is expensive or implicitly done by the computation (e.g., `Collections.sort`)—but be aware of potential failure atomicity loss. When implicit checks throw the wrong exception type, use exception translation (Item 73).

**Code Example:**
```java
/**
 * Returns a BigInteger whose value is (this mod m). This method
 * differs from the remainder method in that it always returns a
 * non-negative BigInteger.
 *
 * @param  m the modulus, which must be positive
 * @return this mod m
 * @throws ArithmeticException if m is less than or equal to 0
 */
public BigInteger mod(BigInteger m) {
    if (m.signum() <= 0)
        throw new ArithmeticException("Modulus <= 0: " + m);
    ... // Do the computation
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Document restrictions and enforce them at method entry.
- Use `Objects.requireNonNull`, `checkIndex`, etc., for common checks.
- Use assertions for non-public method validation.
- Validate parameters before using them, especially when stored for later use.
- Avoid arbitrary restrictions; design methods to be as general as practical.

### Item 50: Make defensive copies when needed

**The Problem:** Java is memory-safe, but clients—whether malicious or mistaken—can violate your invariants if you expose mutable internals. Mutable parameters stored directly, or mutable return values, allow external modification of your object’s state.

**The Rule:** When your class accepts or returns mutable components from clients, defensively copy them so external changes cannot affect your internal state or invariants.

Even in a safe language, you must assume clients will try to break invariants. The classic example is an “immutable” `Period` built from mutable `Date` objects: if you store the original references, callers can mutate them and corrupt the period. Fix by copying parameters in the constructor (and copy before validating, to avoid TOCTOU races) and by copying mutable internal fields in accessors before returning. Do not use `clone()` for defensive copies of parameters whose type might be subclassed by untrusted code—`Date` is non-final, so `clone` might return a malicious subclass. For accessors returning internal `Date` references, `clone` is acceptable since you control the type. Prefer immutable components (e.g., `Instant` over `Date`) to avoid copying. The same principles apply to parameters/return values stored in collections or used as map keys. Performance may sometimes justify skipping copies within the same trusted package, but document that callers must not modify the values.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Repaired constructor - makes defensive copies of parameters
public Period(Date start, Date end) {
    this.start = new Date(start.getTime());
    this.end   = new Date(end.getTime());
    if (this.start.compareTo(this.end) > 0)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(
            this.start + " after " + this.end);
}

// Repaired accessors - make defensive copies of internal fields
public Date start() {
    return new Date(start.getTime());
}
public Date end() {
    return new Date(end.getTime());
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Defensively copy mutable parameters before storing them.
- Defensively copy mutable internal fields before returning them.
- Copy before validation to avoid TOCTOU vulnerabilities.
- Avoid `clone()` for parameter copies when types are subclassable by untrusted code.
- Prefer immutable types (e.g., `Instant`) to eliminate the need for copying.

---

### Item 51: Design method signatures carefully

**The Problem:** Poorly designed method names, excessive convenience methods, long parameter lists, and inappropriate types make APIs hard to learn, use, and maintain—and prone to misuse and bugs.

**The Rule:** Use clear, consistent names; avoid unnecessary convenience methods; keep parameter lists short; favor interfaces over classes for parameter types; and prefer enums over booleans when the meaning is not obvious.

Choose names that are understandable and consistent within your package and with broader conventions. Avoid long names. Do not add convenience methods unless they are frequently used; each method should justify its existence. Limit parameters to about four; long lists, especially with similar types, cause confusion and transposition errors. Shorten lists by splitting methods (e.g., `subList` + `indexOf`), using helper classes to group parameters, or applying the Builder pattern for methods with many optional parameters. Use `Map` instead of `HashMap` as parameter type—favor interfaces over classes. Prefer two-element enums over booleans when clarity matters (e.g., `TemperatureScale.CELSIUS` vs. `true`).

**Code Example:**
```java
public enum TemperatureScale { FAHRENHEIT, CELSIUS }

// Thermometer.newInstance(TemperatureScale.CELSIUS) is clearer than
// Thermometer.newInstance(true)
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use understandable, consistent method names.
- Avoid convenience methods that don’t pull their weight.
- Aim for four or fewer parameters; use helper classes or Builder if needed.
- Prefer interfaces over classes for parameter types.
- Prefer enums over booleans when the meaning is not self-evident.

---

### Item 52: Use overloading judiciously

**The Problem:** Method overloading is resolved at compile time based on static types, not runtime types. This can produce counterintuitive behavior when overloadings with the same number of parameters differ in ways that aren’t “radically different,” and can interact badly with autoboxing, generics, and lambdas.

**The Rule:** Avoid confusing overloadings. Prefer distinct method names over overloadings with the same number of parameters. If you must overload, ensure at least one parameter pair is “radically different” (e.g., `int` vs. `Collection`), and never overload with different functional interfaces in the same argument position.

Overloading selects the method at compile time; overriding selects at runtime. The `CollectionClassifier` example prints “Unknown Collection” three times because the compile-time type is `Collection<?>` for all iterations. With autoboxing, `List.remove(int)` and `List.remove(E)` can both apply—`list.remove(i)` removes by index when `i` is `int`, not by element. For lambdas and method references, overloadings that take different functional interfaces in the same position can confuse the compiler (e.g., `Runnable` vs. `Callable` with `System.out::println`). Safe policies: avoid exporting two overloadings with the same number of parameters; avoid overloading varargs methods; give methods different names when possible (e.g., `writeBoolean`, `writeInt`). For constructors, use static factories when you can. If overloadings must coexist, ensure they behave identically when invoked with the same parameters (e.g., have the more specific one forward to the more general).

**Code Example:**
```java
// Broken! - Prints "Unknown Collection" three times
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Collection<?>[] collections = {
        new HashSet<String>(),
        new ArrayList<BigInteger>(),
        new HashMap<String, String>().values()
    };
    for (Collection<?> c : collections)
        System.out.println(classify(c));  // Always classify(Collection<?>)
}

// Fix: use single method with instanceof
public static String classify(Collection<?> c) {
    return c instanceof Set ? "Set" :
           c instanceof List ? "List" : "Unknown Collection";
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Overloading is resolved at compile time; overriding at runtime.
- Avoid overloadings with the same number of parameters when possible.
- Do not overload methods to take different functional interfaces in the same argument position.
- Autoboxing makes some overloadings ambiguous (e.g., `List.remove`).
- If overloadings coexist, ensure identical behavior for the same arguments.

---

### Item 53: Use varargs judiciously

**The Problem:** Varargs methods allocate an array on every call, which can hurt performance. Also, varargs naturally accept zero arguments, which is wrong when a method logically requires at least one argument.

**The Rule:** Use varargs when you need variable arity. For “one or more” arguments, add a required first parameter before the varargs parameter. In performance-critical code, consider overloadings for common arities (zero through three) plus a varargs fallback.

Varargs create an array of the given size and pass it to the method. For “one or more” (e.g., `min`), require a normal first parameter and use varargs for the rest—this avoids runtime failure when zero args are passed and allows a simple loop. Every varargs call incurs array allocation; for hot paths, use the `EnumSet`-style pattern: overloadings for 0–3 args and a varargs method for the rest. Varargs suit `printf` and reflection; they were designed for such use cases.

**Code Example:**
```java
// The right way to use varargs to pass one or more arguments
static int min(int firstArg, int... remainingArgs) {
    int min = firstArg;
    for (int arg : remainingArgs)
        if (arg < min)
            min = arg;
    return min;
}

// Performance-critical: avoid array allocation for common cases
public void foo() { }
public void foo(int a1) { }
public void foo(int a1, int a2) { }
public void foo(int a1, int a2, int a3) { }
public void foo(int a1, int a2, int a3, int... rest) { }
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Varargs allocate an array on every invocation.
- For “one or more” arguments, use a required parameter plus varargs.
- In performance-critical code, provide fixed-arity overloadings for common cases.
- Varargs are ideal for `printf`-like APIs and reflection.

---

### Item 54: Return empty collections or arrays, not nulls

**The Problem:** Returning `null` for “no elements” forces every caller to add null checks. Omitting the check leads to `NullPointerException` at unrelated call sites. The “saving allocation” argument is weak and often wrong.

**The Rule:** Never return `null` when the semantic meaning is “empty collection” or “empty array.” Return an empty collection or zero-length array instead.

Clients must write `if (x != null && x.contains(...))` and similar patterns, which is verbose and error-prone. Returning null provides no real performance benefit; empty collections and zero-length arrays can be returned without allocating new instances every time (e.g., `Collections.emptyList()`, `EMPTY_CHEESE_ARRAY`). For collections, `return new ArrayList<>(cheesesInStock)` is typically enough. For arrays, `return cheesesInStock.toArray(new Cheese[0])`; do not preallocate with `new Cheese[cheesesInStock.size()]`—it can hurt performance.

**Code Example:**
```java
// The right way to return a possibly empty collection
public List<Cheese> getCheeses() {
    return new ArrayList<>(cheesesInStock);
}

// The right way to return a possibly empty array
public Cheese[] getCheeses() {
    return cheesesInStock.toArray(new Cheese[0]);
}

// Optimization - avoids allocating empty collections
public List<Cheese> getCheeses() {
    return cheesesInStock.isEmpty() ? Collections.emptyList()
        : new ArrayList<>(cheesesInStock);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Never return `null` for an empty collection or array.
- Return shared empty collections/arrays when allocation is a concern.
- Do not preallocate arrays for `toArray`; use `new T[0]`.

---

### Item 55: Return optionals judiciously

**The Problem:** Before Java 8, methods that might not return a value used exceptions or null. Exceptions are costly and indicate exceptional conditions; null is easy to forget to check, leading to `NullPointerException` later.

**The Rule:** Use `Optional<T>` when a method may not return a result and callers must handle absence. Avoid wrapping collections, maps, streams, or arrays in `Optional`; do not use `Optional` as a field, map value, or collection element except in narrow cases.

`Optional` forces callers to confront absence. Use `Optional.of(value)` for non-null values, `Optional.ofNullable(value)` when null is possible, and `Optional.empty()` for no result. Never return null from an `Optional`-returning method. Use `orElse`, `orElseGet`, `orElseThrow` for defaults and error handling; prefer these over `isPresent()` + `get()`. For boxed primitives, use `OptionalInt`, `OptionalLong`, `OptionalDouble` instead of `Optional<Integer>`, etc. `Optional` has allocation cost—avoid in hot loops. Do not use `Optional` as map values (use absent key vs. present key mapping to empty optional). Storing `Optional` in a field can be a code smell; consider whether a subclass or different design fits better.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Returns maximum value in collection as an Optional<E>
public static <E extends Comparable<E>> Optional<E> max(Collection<E> c) {
    if (c.isEmpty())
        return Optional.empty();
    E result = null;
    for (E e : c)
        if (result == null || e.compareTo(result) > 0)
            result = Objects.requireNonNull(e);
    return Optional.of(result);
}

// Using optional to provide a chosen default value
String lastWordInLexicon = max(words).orElse("No words...");
// Using optional to throw a chosen exception
Toy myToy = max(toys).orElseThrow(TemperTantrumException::new);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use `Optional` when a method may not return a value and callers should handle absence.
- Do not return null from `Optional`-returning methods.
- Prefer `orElse`, `orElseGet`, `orElseThrow` over `isPresent()` + `get()`.
- Do not wrap collections, maps, streams, or arrays in `Optional`.
- Use `OptionalInt`, `OptionalLong`, `OptionalDouble` for primitives.
- Avoid using `Optional` as fields, map values, or collection elements.

---

### Item 56: Write doc comments for all exposed API elements

**The Problem:** Undocumented APIs are hard to learn and misuse. Without doc comments, Javadoc can only repeat the declaration, leading to confusion and errors.

**The Rule:** Add Javadoc for every exported class, interface, constructor, method, and field. Describe the contract (what, not how), preconditions, postconditions, and side effects. Use `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, and `@implSpec` where appropriate.

Doc comments are the primary way to document your API. For methods, describe the contract: preconditions (often via `@throws` for unchecked exceptions), postconditions, and side effects. Include `@param` for each parameter, `@return` unless the method is void, and `@throws` for each thrown exception. Use `{@code}` for code fragments and `{@literal}` for text that shouldn’t be treated as HTML. Use `{@implSpec}` for implementation requirements relevant to subclasses (requires `-tag "implSpec:a:Implementation Requirements:"`). The first “sentence” becomes the summary; avoid periods in abbreviations (use `{@literal}`). Document generic type parameters with `@param <T>`. Document enum constants and annotation members. Cover thread-safety and serialization where relevant. Run with `-Xdoclint` and consider `-html5`.

**Code Example:**
```java
/**
 * Returns the element at the specified position in this list.
 *
 * <p>This method is <i>not</i> guaranteed to run in constant
 * time. In some implementations it may run in time proportional
 * to the element position.
 *
 * @param index index of element to return; must be
 *        non-negative and less than the size of this list
 * @return the element at the specified position in this list
 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range
 *         ({@code index < 0 || index >= this.size()})
 */
E get(int index);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Document every exported API element.
- Describe the contract: preconditions, postconditions, side effects.
- Use `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, and `@implSpec` correctly.
- Use `{@code}` and `{@literal}` for code and special characters.
- Document thread-safety and serialization where applicable.

### Item 57: Minimize the scope of local variables

**The Problem:** Variables declared too early clutter the code and extend scope beyond their intended use. They can be accidentally reused, leading to subtle bugs—especially with copy-paste errors in loops.

**The Rule:** Declare local variables at the point of first use. Prefer `for` loops over `while` loops for iteration, so loop variables are scoped to the loop. Keep methods small and focused.

Declaring variables at first use reduces clutter and narrows scope. If a variable is declared before a `try` whose expression can throw, and is needed outside the `try`, it may have to be declared earlier—but that’s the exception. Prefer `for (Element e : c)` and `for (Iterator<Element> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )` over `while` loops. With `while`, a copy-paste error can reuse the wrong iterator (e.g., `i` instead of `i2`), and the bug may compile and run silently. With `for`, the iterator is out of scope in the next loop. For index-based loops, use `for (int i = 0, n = expensiveComputation(); i < n; i++)` to avoid recomputing the bound.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Preferred idiom for iterating over a collection or array
for (Element e : c) {
    ... // Do something with e
}

// Idiom for iterating when you need the iterator
for (Iterator<Element> i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    Element e = i.next();
    ... // Do something with e and i
}

// Minimize scope of loop bound
for (int i = 0, n = expensiveComputation(); i < n; i++) {
    ... // Do something with i
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Declare variables at the point of first use.
- Prefer `for` loops over `while` to limit scope and avoid copy-paste bugs.
- Nearly every local variable should have an initializer.
- Keep methods small to avoid unintentionally shared scope.

### Item 58: Prefer for-each loops to traditional for loops

**The Problem:** Traditional `for` loops with iterators or indices add clutter and many opportunities for off-by-one errors, wrong variable use, and iterator misuse—especially with nested loops.

**The Rule:** Use the for-each loop (`for (Element e : elements)`) whenever you don’t need the iterator or index. It is clearer, less error-prone, and has no performance penalty.

The for-each loop hides iterators and indices, applies uniformly to collections and arrays, and removes most chances for iterator/index mistakes. A classic bug: calling `i.next()` in the inner loop instead of the outer loop when nesting over suits and ranks, producing wrong card combinations or `NoSuchElementException`. For-each eliminates this. Use an explicit loop only when you need to remove elements (or use `removeIf`), replace elements (need index/iterator), or iterate over multiple collections in parallel. Implement `Iterable` for custom types that represent groups of elements so clients can use for-each.

**Code Example:**
```java
// The preferred idiom for iterating over collections and arrays
for (Element e : elements) {
    ... // Do something with e
}

// Preferred idiom for nested iteration on collections and arrays
for (Suit suit : suits)
    for (Rank rank : ranks)
        deck.add(new Card(suit, rank));
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer for-each over iterator/index-based loops.
- For-each avoids iterator and index misuse, including in nested loops.
- Use explicit loops only for destructive filtering, in-place replacement, or parallel iteration.
- Implement `Iterable` for collection-like types.

---

### Item 59: Know and use the libraries

**The Problem:** Programmers often reimplement common functionality (e.g., random number generation) and introduce subtle bugs. Hand-written code is less tested, less optimized, and diverges from the platform over time.

**The Rule:** Use the standard library first. If something seems common, check the library before implementing it yourself. Prefer `ThreadLocalRandom` over `Random`; use `SplittableRandom` for parallel streams.

The flawed `random(n)` using `Math.abs(rnd.nextInt()) % n` has bias, poor distribution, and can return negative values when `nextInt()` returns `Integer.MIN_VALUE`. `Random.nextInt(int)` (or `ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(n)`) handles this correctly. Standard libraries offer expert design, wide use, and continuous improvements. Know the basics of `java.lang`, `java.util`, and `java.io`, plus the collections framework, streams, and `java.util.concurrent`. Check release notes for new features. Use third-party libraries (e.g., Guava) when the platform doesn’t provide what you need.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Use ThreadLocalRandom, not Random
int r = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(upperBound);

// Java 9: printing URL contents
try (InputStream in = new URL(args[0]).openStream()) {
    in.transferTo(System.out);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer standard and trusted third-party libraries over ad-hoc implementations.
- Use `ThreadLocalRandom` for most random number needs.
- Stay current with library additions in new releases.
- Know `java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, and concurrency utilities.

### Item 60: Avoid float and double if exact answers are required

**The Problem:** `float` and `double` use binary floating-point and cannot precisely represent many decimal values (e.g., 0.1). This leads to wrong results in monetary and other exact calculations.

**The Rule:** Do not use `float` or `double` for monetary or other calculations requiring exact decimal results. Use `BigDecimal`, or `int`/`long` with a fixed decimal point (e.g., cents).

`1.03 - 0.42` prints `0.6100000000000001`; `1.00 - 9 * 0.10` prints `0.09999999999999998`. Rounding does not always fix cumulative errors. For money, use `BigDecimal` with `String` constructors (not `double`) to avoid introducing inaccuracies. `BigDecimal` is slower and less convenient; for high performance and when you can manage the decimal point, use `int` or `long` in cents (or smallest unit). Use `int` for up to 9 decimal digits, `long` for up to 18, and `BigDecimal` beyond that.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Correct: use BigDecimal for monetary calculation
final BigDecimal TEN_CENTS = new BigDecimal(".10");
BigDecimal funds = new BigDecimal("1.00");
for (BigDecimal price = TEN_CENTS;
     funds.compareTo(price) >= 0;
     price = price.add(TEN_CENTS)) {
    funds = funds.subtract(price);
    itemsBought++;
}

// Alternative: use int for cents
int funds = 100;  // cents
for (int price = 10; funds >= price; price += 10) {
    funds -= price;
    itemsBought++;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- `float` and `double` are inexact; avoid them for money and exact decimals.
- Use `BigDecimal` with `String` constructors for precise decimal arithmetic.
- Use `int` or `long` in smallest units when performance matters and scale is bounded.
- Never use `BigDecimal` or `float`/`double` constructors with `double` for money.

---

### Item 61: Prefer primitive types to boxed primitives

**The Problem:** Boxed primitives have identity distinct from value, can be null (causing `NullPointerException` on unboxing), and are slower than primitives. Using them carelessly leads to wrong comparisons and poor performance.

**The Rule:** Prefer primitives over boxed primitives. Use boxed primitives only when required: in collections, as type parameters, and in reflection. When using boxed primitives, avoid `==` (use `equals` or unbox first) and watch for auto-unboxing of null.

With `Integer`, `i == j` compares references, not values; two `Integer(42)` instances can compare unequal. Fix by unboxing: `int i = iBoxed; int j = jBoxed;` then compare primitives. A static `Integer` field defaults to null; `i == 42` unboxes null and throws `NullPointerException`. Declaring `Long sum` in a loop causes repeated boxing/unboxing and severe slowdown—use `long sum`. Use boxed primitives only when necessary: collections, type parameters (`ThreadLocal<Integer>`), and reflective invocations.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Broken comparator - i == j compares references!
Comparator<Integer> naturalOrder = (i, j) -> (i < j) ? -1 : (i == j ? 0 : 1);

// Fixed
Comparator<Integer> naturalOrder = (iBoxed, jBoxed) -> {
    int i = iBoxed, j = jBoxed;
    return i < j ? -1 : (i == j ? 0 : 1);
};

// Hideously slow - Long causes repeated boxing
Long sum = 0L;  // Wrong!
for (long i = 0; i < Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++) {
    sum += i;  // Unboxes, adds, boxes
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Primitives have only values; boxed primitives have identity and can be null.
- Never use `==` on boxed primitives; it compares references.
- Null unboxing causes `NullPointerException`.
- Prefer primitives; use boxed primitives only when the language requires it.
- Watch for accidental boxing in loops (e.g., `Long sum`).

---

### Item 62: Avoid strings where other types are more appropriate

**The Problem:** Strings are overused for non-text data: numbers, enums, aggregate values, and capabilities. This leads to parsing errors, poor type safety, and confusing APIs.

**The Rule:** Use the most appropriate type for each piece of data. Use numeric types for numbers, enums for enumerated values, dedicated classes for aggregates, and capability objects (not strings) for access control.

Strings are poor substitutes for value types—parse numeric input into `int`, `BigInteger`, etc. They are poor substitutes for enums (Item 34). For aggregates like `"className#42"`, use a proper class with fields. For capabilities (e.g., thread-local variable keys), string keys create a global namespace—two clients can collide or a malicious client can guess keys. Use unforgeable key objects instead; the real `ThreadLocal` uses the key object as the thread-local variable itself, with a generic type parameter for type safety.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Broken - string as capability, shared namespace
public static void set(String key, Object value);
public static Object get(String key);

// Better - unforgeable key
public static Key getKey() { return new Key(); }
public static void set(Key key, Object value);
public static Object get(Key key);

// Best - ThreadLocal with type safety
public final class ThreadLocal<T> {
    public void set(T value);
    public T get();
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Do not use strings for numeric, enum, or aggregate data.
- Use dedicated value types and parse input into them.
- Use capability objects, not strings, for access control.
- Prefer `ThreadLocal<T>` over string-keyed thread locals.

---

### Item 63: Beware the performance of string concatenation

**The Problem:** Using `+` repeatedly to build strings is O(n²) because strings are immutable—each concatenation copies both operands. For many concatenations, this is far too slow.

**The Rule:** Do not use the string concatenation operator (`+`) in a loop to build a string. Use `StringBuilder` (or `StringBuffer` when thread-safety is needed) instead.

Building a statement with `result += lineForItem(i)` in a loop performs poorly for large `n`. Use `StringBuilder` and `append`. Preallocating the `StringBuilder` with an estimated capacity (e.g., `numItems() * LINE_WIDTH`) can help. For small, fixed concatenations (e.g., a single log line), `+` is fine. Alternatives include character arrays or processing strings without combining them.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Inappropriate - O(n²) for n items
public String statement() {
    String result = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < numItems(); i++)
        result += lineForItem(i);
    return result;
}

// Correct - use StringBuilder
public String statement() {
    StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder(numItems() * LINE_WIDTH);
    for (int i = 0; i < numItems(); i++)
        b.append(lineForItem(i));
    return b.toString();
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Repeated `+` concatenation is O(n²); use `StringBuilder` in loops.
- Preallocate `StringBuilder` when size is known.
- Use `+` only for a small, fixed number of concatenations.

---

### Item 64: Refer to objects by their interfaces

**The Problem:** Declaring variables with concrete implementation types (e.g., `LinkedHashSet`) ties code to that implementation and makes it harder to switch to better or different implementations later.

**The Rule:** Use interface types for parameters, return values, variables, and fields when an appropriate interface exists. Use the concrete class only at construction time.

Declaring `Set<Son> sonSet = new LinkedHashSet<>()` lets you switch to `HashSet` or `TreeSet` by changing only the constructor. If you declare `LinkedHashSet<Son>`, code that depends on iteration order or passes the instance to methods expecting `LinkedHashSet` will break when you change. Use interfaces so the rest of the code is independent of the implementation. Exceptions: value classes like `String` and `BigInteger` (no interface); class-based frameworks like `OutputStream`; classes with methods not in the interface (e.g., `PriorityQueue.comparator()`—use the class only when you need those methods). When an implementation offers extra behavior (e.g., `LinkedHashSet` ordering), ensure any replacement provides equivalent behavior.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Good - uses interface as type
Set<Son> sonSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();

// Bad - uses class as type
LinkedHashSet<Son> sonSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Declare variables, parameters, return values, and fields by interface when possible.
- Use the concrete class only when constructing the object.
- Ensures flexibility to change implementations.
- Document any extra behavior if you depend on a specific implementation.

---

### Item 65: Prefer interfaces to reflection

**The Problem:** Reflection loses compile-time type checking, is verbose, and has worse performance. Using reflection to invoke arbitrary methods leads to runtime failures that could have been caught at compile time.

**The Rule:** Avoid reflection when possible. If you need to work with classes unknown at compile time, use reflection only to instantiate objects, then access them through a known interface or superclass.

Reflection allows access to classes that did not exist at compile time but costs type safety, readability, and performance. Use it only when necessary (e.g., dependency injection, code analysis). When you must instantiate by name, obtain the `Constructor` reflectively, call `newInstance()`, and cast to a known interface (e.g., `Set<String>`). The instantiation code will be verbose and can throw several checked exceptions; the rest of the program works with the interface normally. Catch `ReflectiveOperationException` (Java 7+) to simplify. Use reflection for version compatibility when accessing newer APIs that may be absent. Do not define new `Error` subclasses; use `RuntimeException` for unchecked exceptions.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Reflective instantiation with interface access
Class<? extends Set<String>> cl = (Class<? extends Set<String>>) Class.forName(args[0]);
Constructor<? extends Set<String>> cons = cl.getDeclaredConstructor();
Set<String> s = cons.newInstance();
// Use s normally via Set interface
s.addAll(Arrays.asList(args).subList(1, args.length));
System.out.println(s);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Reflection loses compile-time checking and hurts performance.
- Use reflection only when necessary; prefer interfaces/superclasses.
- Use reflection only for instantiation; access objects via known types.
- Catch `ReflectiveOperationException` to simplify exception handling.

---

### Item 66: Use native methods judiciously

**The Problem:** Native methods (JNI) break Java’s safety guarantees, reduce portability, complicate debugging, and can harm performance (e.g., GC cannot manage native memory). They were once used for performance, but the JVM has improved significantly.

**The Rule:** Use native methods only when necessary: platform-specific features, legacy libraries, or rare cases where Java cannot meet performance needs. Do not use them for general performance tuning.

Legitimate uses: platform-specific facilities (e.g., registries) when no Java API exists, and legacy native libraries with no Java equivalent. Performance is rarely a good reason—the JVM is much faster than it was; `BigInteger` was reimplemented in Java and outperformed the old native version. Native code is unsafe (memory corruption), platform-dependent, harder to debug, and adds glue code. Garbage collection does not manage native memory; crossing the JNI boundary has cost. If you must use native code, minimize it and test thoroughly.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Native methods sacrifice safety, portability, and debuggability.
- Use only for platform-specific or legacy library access.
- Do not use for performance without strong evidence.
- Keep native code minimal and well-tested.

---

### Item 67: Optimize judiciously

**The Problem:** Premature optimization leads to complex, fragile, and sometimes incorrect code. It’s easy to optimize the wrong thing and hard to predict performance without measurement.

**The Rule:** Write clear, correct programs first. Consider performance during design (especially APIs, protocols, data formats). Measure before and after optimizations. Use profilers; replace bad algorithms before micro-optimizing.

“Premature optimization is the root of all evil” (Knuth). Do not warp APIs for performance—e.g., mutable `Dimension` in `getSize()` forced allocations on every call; immutable types or separate width/height methods would have been better. Design choices (mutability, inheritance vs. composition, interfaces vs. classes) affect performance and are hard to change later. After building a clean implementation, measure. Use profilers to find hot spots; fix algorithmic problems first. Java’s performance model is less predictable than C/C++; myths abound—measure on target platforms. Use jmh for microbenchmarks. Repeat: measure, optimize, measure.

**Code Example:**
```java
// API design affects performance - mutable Dimension forces allocation
// Bad: getSize() returns new Dimension() every call
// Better: getWidth() and getHeight(), or immutable Dimension
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Avoid premature optimization; focus on clarity and correctness.
- Consider performance during design, especially for APIs and data formats.
- Measure before and after changes; use profilers.
- Fix algorithms before low-level tuning.
- Java performance is hard to predict—rely on measurement.

---

### Item 68: Adhere to generally accepted naming conventions

**The Problem:** Inconsistent or nonstandard naming confuses other developers, makes APIs harder to use, and can lead to incorrect assumptions and bugs.

**The Rule:** Follow the standard Java naming conventions. Use them consistently; deviate only when conventional usage strongly dictates otherwise.

**Typographical conventions:**
- Packages: lowercase, hierarchical (`com.google.common`)
- Classes/interfaces: PascalCase (`ArrayList`, `FutureTask`)
- Methods/fields: camelCase (`remove`, `getCrc`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MIN_VALUE`)
- Type parameters: single letters (`T`, `E`, `K`, `V`, `R`)

**Grammatical conventions:**
- Classes: singular nouns (`Thread`, `ChessPiece`)
- Interfaces: nouns or -able adjectives (`Runnable`, `Iterable`)
- Methods: verbs for actions (`append`), `is`/`has` for booleans (`isEmpty`), nouns or `getX` for attributes
- Static factories: `of`, `valueOf`, `getInstance`, etc.

Follow the JLS and common practice; use judgment when conventions conflict with long-standing usage.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Follow typographical conventions for packages, classes, methods, fields, constants.
- Use grammatical conventions for readability.
- Consistency matters more than perfection.
- Violate conventions only when conventional usage strongly requires it.

## Chapter 10: Exceptions

---

### Item 69: Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions

**The Problem:** Using exceptions for normal control flow is confusing, slow, and can hide bugs. JVMs optimize for the common case, not for exception throwing; try-catch can inhibit optimizations.

**The Rule:** Use exceptions only for exceptional conditions. Use standard control-flow idioms (e.g., bounds checks, iterator patterns). APIs should not force clients to use exceptions for normal control flow.

The array loop that catches `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to terminate is wrong: it obscures intent, is slower than a normal loop, and can mask real bugs (e.g., an out-of-bounds access inside the loop would be caught and misidentified as loop termination). Provide state-testing methods (e.g., `hasNext()`) or return `Optional`/distinguished values instead of forcing exception-based control flow. Prefer state-testing methods when there’s no time-of-check/time-of-use risk and no duplicated work. Use `Optional` or distinguished values when the object’s state can change between checks or when a separate check would duplicate the operation.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Horrible abuse - don't use exceptions for control flow!
try {
    int i = 0;
    while (true)
        range[i++].climb();
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) { }

// Correct - standard idiom
for (Mountain m : range)
    m.climb();

// Iterator with hasNext - don't use next() in a catch
for (Iterator<Foo> i = collection.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    Foo foo = i.next();
    ...
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Exceptions are for exceptional conditions, not normal control flow.
- Exception-based loops are slow and can mask bugs.
- Provide state-testing methods (e.g., `hasNext`) or `Optional`/distinguished return values.
- Use standard, recognizable idioms.

---

### Item 70: Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors

**The Problem:** Choosing the wrong exception type (checked vs. unchecked) either burdens callers with unrecoverable failures or lets them ignore recoverable ones. Misuse of `Error` and opaque exception types adds confusion.

**The Rule:** Use checked exceptions when the caller can reasonably recover. Use runtime exceptions for programming errors (e.g., precondition violations). Do not define new `Error` subclasses. Provide methods on checked exceptions to aid recovery.

Checked exceptions force callers to handle or propagate; they signal recoverable conditions. Unchecked (runtime) exceptions and errors indicate unrecoverable conditions; recovery is usually impossible. Use `IllegalArgumentException`, `IllegalStateException`, `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for programming errors. Reserve `Error` for the JVM (resource exhaustion, invariant failures). When recovery is unclear, prefer unchecked exceptions (Item 71). Do not create throwables that are neither checked nor runtime. Add accessor methods on checked exceptions (e.g., shortfall amount) to help callers recover. Do not parse exception messages for program logic—use dedicated methods.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Checked exception for recoverable condition - provide recovery info
public class InsufficientFundsException extends Exception {
    private final BigDecimal shortfall;
    public InsufficientFundsException(BigDecimal shortfall) {
        super("Shortfall: " + shortfall);
        this.shortfall = shortfall;
    }
    public BigDecimal getShortfall() { return shortfall; }
}

// Runtime exception for programming error
if (index < 0 || index >= size())
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index: " + index);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Checked: recoverable; unchecked: programming errors.
- Do not define new `Error` subclasses.
- Provide accessor methods on checked exceptions for recovery.
- Do not parse exception messages for logic.

---

### Item 71: Avoid unnecessary use of checked exceptions

**The Problem:** Overuse of checked exceptions makes APIs painful to use. Callers must catch or declare every checked exception; in Java 8+, methods that throw checked exceptions don’t work smoothly in streams.

**The Rule:** Use checked exceptions only when the caller can take useful action and the condition can’t be prevented by correct API use. Prefer `Optional` or state-testing methods when they suffice. If callers can do no better than `throw new AssertionError()` or `System.exit(1)`, use unchecked exceptions.

The burden of checked exceptions is highest when a method throws a single one—it forces a try block. Consider returning `Optional` instead of throwing when no extra context is needed. Alternatively, split into `actionPermitted()` + `action()` so callers can check first; this is inappropriate with concurrent access or when the check would duplicate the action. Use sparingly; when overused, checked exceptions reduce API usability.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Instead of throwing checked exception, return Optional
public Optional<Result> tryCompute() {
    if (cannotCompute())
        return Optional.empty();
    return Optional.of(compute());
}

// Or provide state-testing method
if (obj.actionPermitted(args)) {
    obj.action(args);
} else {
    ... // Handle
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use checked exceptions only when recovery is possible and the condition isn’t preventable.
- Prefer `Optional` when no extra failure info is needed.
- State-testing methods can reduce checked exception usage.
- If callers can’t recover meaningfully, use unchecked exceptions.

---

### Item 72: Favor the use of standard exceptions

**The Problem:** Custom exception types for common situations (illegal argument, illegal state, null, index out of range) make APIs harder to learn and use. Programmers must learn many exception types that mirror standard ones.

**The Rule:** Reuse standard exceptions (`IllegalArgumentException`, `IllegalStateException`, `NullPointerException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, `ConcurrentModificationException`, `UnsupportedOperationException`) when they fit. Base reuse on documented semantics, not just names. Do not reuse `Exception`, `RuntimeException`, `Throwable`, or `Error`.

Reusing standard exceptions makes APIs familiar and reduces class count. Use `IllegalArgumentException` for bad parameter values, `IllegalStateException` for bad object state, `NullPointerException` for prohibited null, `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for bad indices, `ConcurrentModificationException` for concurrent modification, `UnsupportedOperationException` for unsupported operations. If no argument value would work, throw `IllegalStateException`; otherwise `IllegalArgumentException`. Subclass standard exceptions to add detail when needed; ensure they’re serializable.

**Code Example:**
```java
// IllegalArgumentException - inappropriate parameter value
if (n < 0)
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("n must be non-negative: " + n);

// IllegalStateException - object state inappropriate
if (deck.size() < handSize)
    throw new IllegalStateException("Deck has " + deck.size() + " cards");

// NullPointerException - null where prohibited
this.strategy = Objects.requireNonNull(strategy, "strategy");

// IndexOutOfBoundsException - index out of range
if (index < 0 || index >= size())
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index: " + index);
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Reuse standard exceptions when semantics match.
- Do not reuse `Exception`, `RuntimeException`, `Throwable`, `Error`.
- Use `IllegalStateException` when no argument would work; otherwise `IllegalArgumentException`.
- Subclass to add detail; keep exceptions serializable.

---

### Item 73: Throw exceptions appropriate to the abstraction

**The Problem:** Methods that leak lower-level exceptions (e.g., `SQLException`) expose implementation details, pollute the higher-level API, and create coupling—changes in lower layers can break clients.

**The Rule:** Catch lower-level exceptions and throw exceptions that match the higher-level abstraction. Use exception chaining (pass cause to the higher-level exception) when the lower-level exception aids debugging.

Exception translation wraps a lower-level exception in one appropriate to your abstraction. For example, `AbstractSequentialList.get()` catches `NoSuchElementException` from the iterator and throws `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. Exception chaining preserves the cause via `Throwable(Throwable)` or `initCause()` so `getCause()` and the stack trace remain available. Prefer preventing lower-level exceptions (e.g., by validating parameters). When that’s impossible, consider handling them internally (e.g., logging and using a default) so callers aren’t exposed to implementation details.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Exception Translation
try {
    return i.next();
} catch (NoSuchElementException e) {
    throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index: " + index);
}

// Exception Chaining
try {
    ... // Use lower-level abstraction
} catch (LowerLevelException cause) {
    throw new HigherLevelException(cause);
}

class HigherLevelException extends Exception {
    HigherLevelException(Throwable cause) {
        super(cause);
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Catch lower-level exceptions and throw higher-level ones.
- Use exception chaining to preserve the cause for debugging.
- Prefer preventing lower-level exceptions when possible.
- Consider handling internally (e.g., logging) to insulate callers.

---

### Item 74: Document all exceptions thrown by each method

**The Problem:** Undocumented exceptions leave callers unsure which failures can occur and how to handle them. Declaring `throws Exception` or `throws Throwable` hides the real exceptions and hinders effective use.

**The Rule:** Document every exception a method can throw with `@throws`. Declare each checked exception individually in the `throws` clause; do not declare unchecked exceptions (their absence in the declaration signals unchecked). Document unchecked exceptions to describe preconditions.

Declaring `throws Exception` or `throws Throwable` denies useful information. Document checked exceptions with `@throws` and declare them individually. Document unchecked exceptions as well—they describe preconditions. For methods used in streams, precise exception documentation matters. If many methods throw the same exception for the same reason, document it once at the class level. Don’t document `throws` for unchecked exceptions; the `@throws` tag without a `throws` clause makes it clear they are unchecked. When a method is revised to throw new unchecked exceptions, clients may propagate them without documenting—an inherent limitation.

**Code Example:**
```java
/**
 * Returns the element at the specified position in this list.
 *
 * @param index index of element to return
 * @return the element at the specified position
 * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range
 *         ({@code index < 0 || index >= size()})
 */
public E get(int index)  // No "throws" for unchecked
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Document every thrown exception with `@throws`.
- Declare checked exceptions individually; do not declare unchecked.
- Document unchecked exceptions to describe preconditions.
- Class-level docs can cover exceptions thrown by many methods.

---

### Item 75: Include failure-capture information in detail messages

**The Problem:** When a program fails, the exception’s detail message and stack trace are often the only diagnostic information. Vague or missing detail messages make debugging difficult, especially for intermittent failures.

**The Rule:** Include in the detail message the values of all parameters and fields that contributed to the failure. Use constructor parameters to ensure this info is captured. Provide accessor methods for recovery (especially on checked exceptions). Do not include security-sensitive data.

For `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, include lower bound, upper bound, and index. That distinguishes fencepost errors, bad bounds, and wild values. Avoid long prose; the stack trace plus docs are the main context. Do not include passwords or keys. Prefer constructors that take failure-capture data (e.g., `IndexOutOfBoundsException(int index, int lowerBound, int upperBound)`) and generate the message internally. Provide accessors on checked exceptions to support recovery; consider them for unchecked exceptions as well.

**Code Example:**
```java
/**
 * Constructs an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
 *
 * @param lowerBound the lowest legal index value
 * @param upperBound the highest legal index value plus one
 * @param index      the actual index value
 */
public IndexOutOfBoundsException(int lowerBound, int upperBound, int index) {
    super(String.format(
        "Lower bound: %d, Upper bound: %d, Index: %d",
        lowerBound, upperBound, index));
    this.lowerBound = lowerBound;
    this.upperBound = upperBound;
    this.index = index;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Detail messages should capture all values that contributed to the failure.
- Use constructor parameters to enforce inclusion of failure data.
- Provide accessors for recovery, especially on checked exceptions.
- Do not include security-sensitive data in detail messages.

---

### Item 76: Strive for failure atomicity

**The Problem:** When a method throws an exception, the object may be left in a corrupted, inconsistent state. Callers expecting to recover from checked exceptions may find the object unusable. Future operations may fail in confusing ways.

**The Rule:** A method that throws an exception should leave the object in the state it was in before the invocation (or in a well-defined, documented state). Achieve this through immutability, parameter validation, ordered computation, or copying before modification.

Immutable objects are naturally failure-atomic—failure prevents creation of a new object but never corrupts an existing one. For mutable objects, check parameters before modifying state (Item 49); most failures occur before any changes. Order computation so failure-prone work happens before modifications (e.g., `TreeMap` fails on bad keys before modifying the tree). Use temporary copies when appropriate (e.g., sort into a copy, then swap). Rollback is a last resort, mainly for persistent structures. Failure atomicity is not always achievable (e.g., concurrent modification) or desirable (cost/complexity). Document state when failure atomicity cannot be guaranteed.

**Code Example:**
```java
public Object pop() {
    if (size == 0)
        throw new EmptyStackException();
    Object result = elements[--size];
    elements[size] = null;  // Eliminate obsolete reference
    return result;
}
// Parameter check ensures exception is thrown before size is modified
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Failed invocations should leave objects in a consistent state.
- Use immutability, parameter checks, ordered computation, or copying.
- Document when failure atomicity cannot be guaranteed.
- Check parameters before modifying state.

### Item 77: Don’t ignore exceptions

**The Problem:** Empty catch blocks swallow exceptions, hide failures, and can lead to program misbehavior or failure at unrelated points. The purpose of exceptions is to force handling of exceptional conditions.

**The Rule:** Do not use empty catch blocks. If you intentionally ignore an exception, document why in a comment and name the variable `ignored`. Prefer handling the exception, propagating it, or at least logging it.

An empty catch block is like turning off a fire alarm—you might avoid dealing with a problem, or the results may be serious. Proper handling can prevent failure; propagating allows fast failure with useful debugging info. When ignoring is appropriate (e.g., when closing a stream after reading, with no recovery action), add a comment and use `ignored` as the variable name. Consider logging so recurring issues can be investigated. This applies to both checked and unchecked exceptions.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Empty catch block - Highly suspect!
try {
    ...
} catch (SomeException e) {
}

// Appropriate to ignore - with comment and named variable
Future<Integer> f = exec.submit(planarMap::chromaticNumber);
int numColors = 4;
try {
    numColors = f.get(1L, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
} catch (TimeoutException | ExecutionException ignored) {
    // Use default: minimal coloring is desirable, not required
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Never use truly empty catch blocks.
- Document why an exception is ignored; name the variable `ignored`.
- Prefer handling, propagating, or logging over ignoring.
- Applies to both checked and unchecked exceptions.

### Item 78: Synchronize access to shared mutable data

**The Problem:** Shared mutable data accessed by multiple threads without synchronization can lead to liveness and safety failures that are hard to reproduce and VM-dependent.

**The Rule:** Every thread that reads or writes shared mutable data must use synchronization. Without it, updates from one thread are not guaranteed to be visible to others, even for atomic operations.

Synchronization does two things: mutual exclusion (preventing inconsistent state) and memory visibility (ensuring threads see each other's updates). A common mistake is omitting synchronization for seemingly atomic fields like booleans. `volatile` is enough when you only need visibility, not mutual exclusion, but does not provide atomicity for compound operations like `++`.

**Code Example:**
```java
public class StopThread {
    private static volatile boolean stopRequested;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread backgroundThread = new Thread(() -> {
            int i = 0;
            while (!stopRequested) i++;
        });
        backgroundThread.start();
        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);
        stopRequested = true;
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Synchronization provides both mutual exclusion and memory visibility
- Both reads and writes of shared mutable data must be synchronized
- Use `volatile` only when visibility is needed, not atomicity
- Use `AtomicLong` (or similar) for lock-free, atomic operations on a single variable
- Prefer not sharing mutable data: use immutables or thread confinement

---

### Item 79: Avoid excessive synchronization

**The Problem:** Too much synchronization can cause deadlocks, exceptions, performance issues, and non-portable behavior.

**The Rule:** Never call alien (client-provided or overridable) methods from inside a synchronized method or block, and minimize work inside synchronized regions.

Use open calls: take a snapshot of data inside the synchronized block, then release the lock and call alien methods outside. `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is ideal for rarely modified, often traversed lists (e.g. observer lists). Keep synchronized sections short. For mutable classes, either leave synchronization to clients or make the class thread-safe internally.

**Code Example:**
```java
private final List<SetObserver<E>> observers = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();

public void addObserver(SetObserver<E> observer) { observers.add(observer); }
public boolean removeObserver(SetObserver<E> observer) { return observers.remove(observer); }

private void notifyElementAdded(E element) {
    for (SetObserver<E> observer : observers)
        observer.added(this, element);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Never invoke alien methods from synchronized regions
- Use `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for observer lists
- Minimize work inside synchronized blocks
- Consider whether the class should synchronize internally or let clients do it

---

### Item 80: Prefer executors, tasks, and streams to threads

**The Problem:** Manually managing threads and work queues is error-prone and unnecessary given the Executor Framework.

**The Rule:** Use the Executor Framework and tasks instead of creating threads directly.

Use `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` for a simple work queue, `newCachedThreadPool()` for light load, and `newFixedThreadPool()` or `ThreadPoolExecutor` for heavy production load. Cached pools can create unbounded threads under load and should be avoided in production.

**Code Example:**
```java
ExecutorService exec = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
exec.execute(runnable);
exec.shutdown();
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer Executor Framework over raw threads
- For production, prefer `newFixedThreadPool()` or `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Use parallel streams for fork-join parallelism when appropriate

---

### Item 81: Prefer concurrency utilities to wait and notify

**The Problem:** Using `wait` and `notify` directly is low-level and error-prone; higher-level utilities are simpler and safer.

**The Rule:** Prefer utilities in `java.util.concurrent` (executors, concurrent collections, synchronizers) over hand-coded `wait` and `notify`.

Concurrent collections handle their own synchronization. Synchronizers like `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, and `CyclicBarrier` coordinate threads. If you must use `wait`, always call it inside a `while` loop. Use `notifyAll` by default.

**Code Example:**
```java
public static long time(Executor executor, int concurrency, Runnable action)
        throws InterruptedException {
    CountDownLatch ready = new CountDownLatch(concurrency);
    CountDownLatch start = new CountDownLatch(1);
    CountDownLatch done = new CountDownLatch(concurrency);
    for (int i = 0; i < concurrency; i++) {
        executor.execute(() -> {
            ready.countDown();
            try { start.await(); action.run(); }
            catch (InterruptedException e) { Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); }
            finally { done.countDown(); }
        });
    }
    ready.await();
    long startNanos = System.nanoTime();
    start.countDown();
    done.await();
    return System.nanoTime() - startNanos;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use `java.util.concurrent` instead of `wait` and `notify`
- If using `wait`, always use a `while` loop
- Prefer `notifyAll` over `notify`
- Use `System.nanoTime()` for interval timing

---

### Item 82: Document thread safety

**The Problem:** Clients need to know how a class behaves under concurrency; unclear documentation leads to too little or too much synchronization.

**The Rule:** Clearly document a class's thread-safety guarantee, and prefer the private lock idiom for internally synchronized classes.

Thread safety levels: **Immutable** (e.g. `String`), **Unconditionally thread-safe** (e.g. `ConcurrentHashMap`), **Conditionally thread-safe** (e.g. `Collections.synchronized*`), **Not thread-safe** (e.g. `ArrayList`), **Thread-hostile** (rare, usually a bug).

**Code Example:**
```java
private final Object lock = new Object();

public void foo() {
    synchronized(lock) { ... }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Document thread-safety level for every class
- `synchronized` is an implementation detail, not documentation
- Use a private `final` lock for unconditionally thread-safe classes

---

### Item 83: Use lazy initialization judiciously

**The Problem:** Lazy initialization can hurt performance and introduces concurrency complexity.

**The Rule:** Favor normal initialization; use lazy initialization only when necessary, and use the correct pattern for the field type and usage.

For static fields, use the **lazy initialization holder class idiom**. For instance fields, use the **double-check idiom** with `volatile`. For fields that can tolerate repeated init, consider the **single-check idiom**.

**Code Example:**
```java
// Double-check idiom for lazy initialization of instance fields
private volatile FieldType field;

private FieldType getField() {
    FieldType result = field;
    if (result == null) {
        synchronized(this) {
            if (field == null)
                field = result = computeFieldValue();
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer normal initialization; use lazy initialization only when needed
- For static fields, use the holder class idiom
- For instance fields, use double-check with `volatile`
- All lazy initialization patterns must be thread-safe

---

### Item 84: Don't depend on the thread scheduler

**The Problem:** Relying on scheduling behavior or thread priorities leads to brittle, non-portable programs.

**The Rule:** Do not depend on the thread scheduler for correctness or performance. Keep the number of runnable threads close to the number of processors and avoid busy-waiting.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Keep runnable threads close to the number of processors
- Avoid busy-waiting
- Do not use `Thread.yield()` for correctness or portability
- Do not rely on thread priorities for correctness

## Chapter 12: Serialization

---

### Item 85: Prefer alternatives to Java serialization

**The Problem:** Java serialization has a large, hard-to-secure attack surface and is responsible for serious security incidents including ransomware.

**The Rule:** Avoid Java serialization for new systems. Use JSON or Protocol Buffers instead. If you must use it, never deserialize untrusted data.

`readObject` acts like a magic constructor that can instantiate almost any `Serializable` type on the classpath. Deserialization bombs can cause denial-of-service with a small byte stream. If you must use serialization: use Java 9+ object deserialization filtering (prefer whitelisting over blacklisting).

**Key Takeaways:**
- Avoid Java serialization in new systems
- Use JSON or Protocol Buffers as alternatives
- Never deserialize untrusted data
- Deserialization bombs can cause DoS with small byte streams

---

### Item 86: Implement Serializable with great caution

**The Problem:** Making a class serializable has long-term costs: API coupling, more bugs and security risks, and extra testing.

**The Rule:** Treat `Serializable` as a significant commitment. Implement it only when necessary, and design with care.

Declaring `implements Serializable` ties the class's serialized form to its public API. Deserialization bypasses normal constructors. Declare an explicit `serialVersionUID` to avoid unintended incompatibility. Classes designed for inheritance and interfaces should rarely implement `Serializable`.

**Key Takeaways:**
- `Serializable` commits the serialized form to the API
- Deserialization acts as a hidden constructor
- Declare an explicit `serialVersionUID`
- Avoid `Serializable` for classes designed for inheritance and for inner classes

---

### Item 87: Consider using a custom serialized form

**The Problem:** Default serialization can bind the API to implementation details and hurt flexibility, size, speed, and stack depth.

**The Rule:** Do not accept the default serialized form without deliberate design. Use a custom form when physical and logical representations differ.

Use `transient` for derived fields, cache fields, and implementation details. Always call `defaultWriteObject` and `defaultReadObject` for forward compatibility.

**Code Example:**
```java
private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream s) throws IOException {
    s.defaultWriteObject();
    s.writeInt(size);
    for (Entry e = head; e != null; e = e.next)
        s.writeObject(e.data);
}

private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    s.defaultReadObject();
    int numElements = s.readInt();
    for (int i = 0; i < numElements; i++)
        add((String) s.readObject());
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Accept default serialized form only when physical and logical representations match
- Use `transient` for derived and implementation-specific fields
- Always call `defaultWriteObject` and `defaultReadObject`
- Declare `serialVersionUID`

---

### Item 88: Write readObject methods defensively

**The Problem:** `readObject` is effectively a public constructor and can be fed crafted byte streams that violate invariants or expose mutable internals.

**The Rule:** Treat `readObject` like a constructor: validate inputs and defensively copy mutable components. Copy before validating.

**Code Example:**
```java
private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
    s.defaultReadObject();
    start = new Date(start.getTime());
    end   = new Date(end.getTime());
    if (start.compareTo(end) > 0)
        throw new InvalidObjectException(start + " after " + end);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Treat `readObject` as a constructor that must handle arbitrary byte streams
- Validate and defensively copy mutable components
- Copy before validation to avoid TOCTOU vulnerabilities
- Prefer the serialization proxy pattern when possible

---

### Item 89: For instance control, prefer enum types to readResolve

**The Problem:** Serializable singletons lose their single-instance guarantee because deserialization creates new instances.

**The Rule:** Prefer single-element enum types for serializable instance-controlled classes. Use `readResolve` only when enums are not possible.

Enum singletons are robust: Java guarantees exactly the declared constants. With `readResolve`, all object-reference instance fields must be `transient`.

**Code Example:**
```java
public enum Elvis {
    INSTANCE;
    private String[] favoriteSongs = { "Hound Dog", "Heartbreak Hotel" };
    public void printFavorites() {
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(favoriteSongs));
    }
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Prefer single-element enums for serializable singletons
- Use `readResolve` only when enums are not an option
- With `readResolve`, all object-reference instance fields must be `transient`

---

### Item 90: Consider serialization proxies instead of serialized instances

**The Problem:** Serialization bypasses normal constructors and makes it easy to violate invariants.

**The Rule:** Use the serialization proxy pattern to move serialization logic into a dedicated proxy class and create real instances via normal constructors.

Define a private static nested class (the serialization proxy) that mirrors the logical state. Implement `writeReplace` to return the proxy, `readObject` on the main class to reject direct deserialization, and `readResolve` on the proxy to construct via the public API. It does not work for client-extendable classes or circular object graphs.

**Code Example:**
```java
private static class SerializationProxy implements Serializable {
    private final Date start;
    private final Date end;

    SerializationProxy(Period p) { this.start = p.start; this.end = p.end; }

    private Object readResolve() { return new Period(start, end); }
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 234098243823485285L;
}

private Object writeReplace() { return new SerializationProxy(this); }

private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream) throws InvalidObjectException {
    throw new InvalidObjectException("Proxy required");
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- The serialization proxy pattern uses constructors to enforce invariants
- Works well for non-extensible classes with nontrivial invariants
- Does not support client-extensible classes or circular object graphs
- Consider it whenever you would otherwise write `readObject` or `writeObject`
